And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states.

For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about who WordPress is built for. I was talking to a group of contributors last week and we encountered some questions around just who WordPress is built for. And it&#8217;s a question that you&#8217;ll find any time that you&#8217;re working on user testing or on triaging tickets, and especially when that comes up when you look at the big picture, roadmap sorts of things. The easiest answer for this question is, of course, everyone because WordPress&#8217; mission is to democratize publishing and that should be available to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>[00:01:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, everyone is a really big target and certainly doesn&#8217;t help get your mind around the people that you&#8217;re wanting to actually build it for, the people that you actually want to be able to use your product, your software on a day-to-day basis. So let&#8217;s take a look at the one question that can help us figure out who it&#8217;s built for today and how we get it to being something that&#8217;s built forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a basic premise of open source that informs this thought. And that premise is that we are citizens of a community of contributors therefore the decisions are made by the people who show up. In general, I believe that to be true, though, I also believe that some basic qualifications are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, the one question that can help us figure out who a software is built for is this: how do your active contributors see themselves? I would bet that most contributors to open source software projects, like WordPress, are developers of some sort, it is sort of written right into the definition of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work on software, then you need developers. And what I love about WordPress, in particular, is that we do work to include contributors who are not developers. Yet it still remains true that there is a fairly high level of technical knowledge required to actively contribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:2:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of brings us to the second half of the original question of how can we make sure that WordPress can be something that&#8217;s built for everyone? The answer to this one is easy to say, hard to do, and that is to make sure to include them as co-creators in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about co-creators in open source before. It&#8217;s this idea that people who use the software every day are likely to know the biggest pain points. So if you want your software to be used by people who don&#8217;t know HTML, talk to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t know HTML about how it is to use your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your software to be mostly used by enterprise agencies, talk to enterprise agencies, but also ask them what their clients hate, because everyone has more than one stakeholder. And I know that I said this already, but it bears repeating that, obviously, this is all very easy to say and hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:3:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is my best guess for the how-to-do part for WordPress? There are three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is testing. This not only helps bring in new contributors and helps train future contributors, which I&#8217;ve talked about on the podcast before. But testing also gives us a higher chance of actionable feedback from folks who don&#8217;t necessarily spend time directly in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequently the feedback that we do get that is just kind of undirected and ad hoc is exactly that– it is undirected and ad hoc and is then hard to follow up on and make sure that we understand what was wrong and how we can help fix it. And so testing is important for that. And testing it turns out is important for a bunch of things. When you&#8217;re working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is support. So checking in with support teams at hosts, as well as the hardworking support teams in the project. And that can really help us to get early indications of what difficulties exist now. They have routinely seen problems and issues that are raised in support forums, and from their everyday users that they are providing support to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably could be fixed in WordPress if we had a good understanding of just what was not going right, how many people really needed it to go better, and what our targets were to fix that particular problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:4:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is communication. I know that I&#8217;ve gone on record in many places as saying that most of our problems at the end of the day are communication problems. And I&#8217;m going on record about it again here in this podcast, establishing better communication patterns with users is key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can be a multi-year project in itself. And even after that, it&#8217;s going to be an ongoing journey. But it is one of the many things that WordCamps and other WordPress events have given to us over the years, an opportunity to really hear from and see the struggles that people who are not building with WordPress every day, or literally building WordPress every day are actually having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:5:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve heard my small list of way too big things, that brings us to our regular small list of big things. The first thing is that WordCamp Europe is still looking for volunteers. If you&#8217;ve never done that before, I think it&#8217;s quite fun. You get to meet a lot of people and the team of organizers is super fun, but I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a new code-free way to contribute through the photo directory. That team is just getting started and still is working toward building out its programs. So now&#8217;s a good time to drop in and just kind of see what they are up to. And finally, a reminder that we do have contributors who are affected by the war in Ukraine right now. I will reshare the list of humanitarian organizations in case you missed them a couple of weeks ago as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:6:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for this WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/wordpress-5-9-2-security-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:24:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"WordPress 5.9.2&#160;is now available!

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt.

In 2007, Tonya started to face health challenges that had an impact on all that she had known.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I did not recognize myself.</strong></p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, she woke up at home ready to visit a client’s facility where her firm was building a robotic system. She said: “As I headed for the door, I fell to my knees, as this wave of pain crushed down on my chest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors diagnosed her with a very rare heart disease that caused her blood vessels to spasm, cutting off blood to whatever was downstream of the blockage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, she was diagnosed with a second rare and more serious condition, related to the migraines from which she had been suffering. Combined with her heart condition, this made every migraine attack life-threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly seven years, the unexpected changes to her health left her mostly homebound and constantly monitored. This meant she had to close her engineering firm and say goodbye to staff and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I was lost. I didn’t recognize myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in her darkest hour, she found her strength. Tonya made a choice to move forward, and make the most of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you are at rock bottom, you have to make a decision or else it will consume you. My decision was that I chose to be happy,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Tonya’s first steps was to start writing a blog using WordPress. In this she shared insights on how to find peace and joy in any situation. She wrote about kindness and helping one another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of making solutions through WordPress became a way for Tonya to accept her new life and not feel as limited by her health. She wanted purpose, and in WordPress, she found just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya felt she could do something worthwhile in the virtual world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-ray-of-hope-for-tonya\">A ray of hope for Tonya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Tonya’s health deteriorated further. She was admitted into intensive care and was diagnosed with a third rare disease, this time related to her autoimmunity. She was not expected to survive this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following what she describes as a ‘miraculous recovery,’ she became stronger and was able to stop relying on a wheelchair. She used the energy from working on websites to keep going. “WordPress kept my mind alive,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had first used WordPress for her engineering firm’s intranet. But when she discovered the software’s full potential and the collaborative opportunities of open source, it opened a new world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again&#8221;</p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years which followed, she donated her time to build some WordPress websites and plugins. She said: “Through giving my time, I was able to do something other than sit in isolation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya was amazed by the sharing in open source in general and in WordPress in particular. She said: “I was amazed to see people sharing so much information freely with one another. In my former engineering world, information was proprietary. Throughout my career, I had worked to break down those silos and help anyone to understand complex systems. I was drawn to this open community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also became aware that WordPress developers were hungry to learn more about development. She wanted to be part of the solution with her passion for teaching and the knowledge she had gained in industry.<br><br>She said: “Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again. Here in this community, I was able to feel like a person again, not a sick one, but a professional with something to give.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest in the software grew, Tonya decided to start a non-profit where she turned to WordPress to build the websites. This re-sparked her interest in programming. She said: “I wanted to really know the code and understand what made it tick.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realization led Tonya to start the WP Developers’ Club, which in turn spawned <a href=\"https://knowthecode.io/\">Know the Code</a>, to help educate individual developers, and is still used today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-helping-wordpress-companies-to-working-on-wordpress-core\">From helping WordPress companies to working on WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured with her dog\" class=\"wp-image-12328\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya went on to work with big and medium size WordPress companies helping their developers and supporting them in raising their firms’ leverage with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2020, she knew she wanted to do even more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Tonya joined an international firm in the ecosystem and began working closely on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, WordPress Core was pulling together a new Triage team. Tonya started volunteering on that team to find collaborative solutions, and help others do so. In 2020 for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">WordPress 5.6 Simone</a>, she became the release’s Triage lead, and again for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-7/\">WordPress 5.7 Esperanza</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, she became a Test Team Rep and helped to expand the team and is an advocate for the value of testing and feedback in the release development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-successful-chapter-with-wordpress-5-9\">A new, successful chapter with WordPress 5.9</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya was one of the notable contributors to the WordPress 5.9 release featured in this picture.\" class=\"wp-image-12329\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1536%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=2048%2C959&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya’s passion for the software and getting people involved in its growth continued. For the WordPress 5.9 release in 2021, she took on the role of both the Core Tech Lead and the Release Coordinator. As this was a big release and included the first major implementation of Full Site Editing, it had many moving parts and hundreds of contributors. She was able to share the skills she had learned in communication and project management from her days streamlining and documenting engineering software and processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 24 hours of WordPress 5.9 landing, it had more than 10 million downloads—and 17 formally reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-back-to-open-source\">Giving back to open source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in what Tonya describes as her third chapter. She said: “I’m a very different person from the engineer I used to know. What really matters in this world is when you reach out and make a difference in someone’s life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels she has found her purpose in this life. “I’m on a mission to give back and make a difference. Teaching is how I will do it. And in WordPress I have found my professional home, and I have all this software knowledge that I just want to share.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors-to-this-feature\">Contributors to this feature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tonya Mork (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellofromtonya/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>hellofromtonya</a>) for sharing her story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviews and feature by Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>).

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy &#8211; here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a non-mailbag mailbag question that I would like to answer for y&#8217;all today. Non-mailbag because no one actually emailed me about it and mailbag because Twitter is basically like a giant mailbag. And I do get a lot of DMS about this particular topic. If you want to send something to my actual WP Briefing mailbag, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@worpress.org\">wpbriefing@worpress.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question that I frequently get asked in my DMS on Twitter is: what is Five for the Future? It&#8217;s not always that tidy the question, but that still is the question we&#8217;re answering today. So if you take a casual survey of active contributors to the WordPress project, the high-level answer that you&#8217;re likely to get to that question is “a way to remind people to give back to the project.” Or, if you run in more business-y circles, you might hear that it is an initiative that encourages companies to give back 5% of their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of those answers are true. So a quick mini-history lesson; the original concept of Five for the Future came from Matt Mullenweg in 2014. There&#8217;s a lovely blog post on it that I will link in the notes below, but it was essentially a call to any companies experiencing success with WordPress to contribute back to the project and make sure that the project was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial program then included outreach recognition, et cetera, proposed in 2017 by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/liljimmi/\">Tracy Levesque</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a>. Then that was defined and formalized with the help of the WordPress community in 2018. And then, in 2019, we had our first trial run with entire dedicated teams sponsored by companies inside the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the mini-history lesson chronology of this program. The intentions that informed the work of building the program in 2017 have become a bit lost to the ages. So I&#8217;m here to share it with you. The basic heart and soul of the Five for the Future program is to make sure that there is a way to refresh the commons of the WordPress community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a result, ensure that the common resources of WordPress are available long after we have stopped being available to care for them. If you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, Five for the Future was created to help avoid that tragedy. There were two original goals for formalizing the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one was to acknowledge companies that participated in Five for the Future by sponsoring contributors to work on the WordPress project. And the second was to motivate more companies to sponsor more volunteers. Either by hiring them and paying them to contribute or by assigning their existing employees to contribute to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to quantify participation and hard to qualify what should be seen as an impactful contribution, which is why when the program was originally created, it was in partnership with team reps and community members who were active at the time. There are many posts around that discuss the next steps for this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;m looking through them, the next steps revolve around some of the hardest and most important questions that we have to answer as a project and as stewards of open source. Those questions are things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> How do we remain true to these gloriously subversive values of WordPress and open source while also finding a way to thoughtfully secure our organization&#8217;s future?</li><li>Does contributing without the expectation of reciprocity hold up when we are looking at how to acknowledge contributors who sustain us?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re familiar with Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s award-winning work, Governing the Commons, you may also be wondering how this particular program aligns with her eight principles designed to sustain organizations like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:57]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside to that last question, this particular program does not have all eight principles accounted for, but among WordPress&#8217;s many programs, we do account for most of them. Although imperfectly, as is the way with human beings, that&#8217;s probably a whole episode unto itself, I did want to quickly answer that particular question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get back to my non-mailbag, mailbag question, if I had to tell you in the span of an elevator ride what Five for the Future was, this would be my answer. <strong>It is a v1 program with a dual goal of boldly declaring the need to refresh the shared resources of WordPress and offering the ways and means for communities and individuals alike to participate in refreshing those resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out wordpress.org/5. Like literally just the number five. Or, if you want to learn more about the program that has grown from the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out the white paper that&#8217;s linked in the notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Number one on my small list, the planning post for WordPress 6.0 is out. I&#8217;ve included a link in my massive list of links below. But it includes our best guess at timing, features that we intend to include, and a call for volunteers as well. So if you are looking for ways to give back, that is a clear and immediate option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is if you are a team rep, don&#8217;t forget that we have daylight saving time ending and starting depending on your hemisphere within the month. If you move meetings, if you&#8217;re in a team that moves your meetings, discuss it now so that folks have time to adjust their calendars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on my small list of big things is that there&#8217;s a suite of Full Site Editing courses that are now available on learn.wordpress.org. I will add that to my giant list of links below, but I encourage you to wander on over and see what all the fuss is about. I think the courses are excellent.

Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I published a post about the big picture goals for the WordPress project in 2022. As I was thinking through our planned releases for the year and looking out toward what would spell success for WordPress over the next three years, three things really lined up in both sets of answers for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I provided some detail on how we can work toward these goals in the post, which I will link for you in the show notes, but I also wanted to take some time to explain why I feel we have to work toward these goals this year. So these all build on one another. To refresh your memory of the three big focuses, they are one to drive adoption of the new editor in WordPress, support open source alternatives for site building necessities, and three, open source stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one; is driving the adoption of the new WordPress editor. Early on in the start of the Gutenberg Project, folks could not go two days without hearing me talk about the phases of adoption and how those line up with the phases of Gutenberg, and who would need our support the most in each of those phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always believed that what we would be shipping at this point in our project would prove the plausible promise of what we were doing in phase one. That&#8217;s definitely what I&#8217;m seeing from what was shipped in 5.9, as well as what we plan to ship in May with 6.0. And the people who need the most support right now are absolutely our users, your clients, no matter whether they were not keeping up with WordPress developments or simply were waiting to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be people who look to you as someone who has been here a while to help them make sense of what they&#8217;re seeing. And what I find so exciting about this adoption, sort of, work in the WordPress project is that this is the time when we as practitioners of WordPress, no matter whether you are a designer or a developer or builder, business coach. This is the time when we get to guide others through the hardest parts of our learning processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of helping people to learn new technologies relies not only on your hard-won expertise but also on the belief that the future is worth fighting for. Enabling someone’s success is an investment in the future and investment for that person or for WordPress or your community. All investments are welcome here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, table stakes are just that you care. And speaking of future investments, the second focus is open source alternatives for site building necessities. So things like images, forms, stores, themes, etc. It literally just things you need to build a site. I would like to start by saying that I am completely aware of the fact that 99% of WordPress users will never care about open source freedoms and philosophies in the same way that WordPress maintainers and contributors care about open source freedoms and philosophies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could substitute the name of any other open source project right there, and the statement would still be true. And yet, I will always believe that people should have the rights and freedoms that open source brings to them even if they do not know they are there. And so it makes all the sense in the world to me that as a project and open source community, we should strive to make choosing Open Source as easy as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, open source stewardship is one of the focuses for this year. This one is obviously about supporting open source as a concept and maintaining WordPress as a project. But I also think that it is relevant to our current global circumstances. Open Source suddenly became very visible to the public eye last year following the Log4J vulnerability, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been hearing consistent concern over how We make sure that WordPress is sustainable moving into the future. Fortunately, this is a topic that&#8217;s near and dear to my heart. And I have been delighted to see so many community members bringing that conversation to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot that is done in the WordPress project to keep us from the tragedy of the commons. But that work honestly never ends. Not only does it not end, but as we get bigger, there is more and more that we can and should be doing to keep us around for the long term. And, of course, for the keen readers of my posts, there&#8217;s a bonus focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus focus is, of course, that WordPress turns 20 years old next year. This year, we will also be seeing some preparatory work for that major milestone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us today to our small list of big things. There is a redesign of the News Page coming. We&#8217;ve been talking about this over on make.wordpress.org/design for a bit since like June of last year or something. But it&#8217;s coming in the next few weeks. I&#8217;ll share a link to the GitHub repo in case anyone has any specific things that they see as they are reading through all of our many news stories that come out on that particular page.

This is more than just a new default theme. It’s a brand-new way to work with WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/\">Block themes</a> put a wide array of visual choices directly in your hands, from color schemes and font combinations to page templates and image filters, all from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor/\">Site Editor</a>. So in one place, you can give Twenty Twenty-Two the same look and feel as your organization’s other materials—or take your site’s look in another direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already have the Twenty Twenty-Two theme—it came installed with WordPress 5.9. You will find it with your other installed themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12102\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"your-personal-paintbox-awaits\">Your personal paintbox awaits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two is not the only theme built for full site editing. More block themes are in the Themes directory, and the number will grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use any of those new themes, you no longer need the Customizer. Instead, you have all the power of the Styles interface inside the Site Editor. Just as in Twenty Twenty-Two, you build your site’s look and feel there, with the tools you need for the job in a fluid interface that practically comes alive in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-navigation-block\">The Navigation block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks come to site navigation, the heart of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Navigation block gives you the power to choose: an always-on responsive menu or one that adapts to your user’s screen size.

And you can edit them as you see fit. Need something different in the header or footer for your theme? Swap it out with a new one in a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a nearly full-screen view that draws you in to see fine details, the Pattern Explorer makes it easy to compare patterns and choose the one your users need.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12106\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-revamped-list-view\">A revamped List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.9, the List View lets you drag and drop your content exactly where you want it.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday marked three years since the WordPress project welcomed me as their executive director. As I start my fourth year, I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time considering what the next five years will bring us. WordPress will turn 19 this year, which means that we will soon be a whopping 20 years old; for some of the people who have been with the project since the beginning, that can represent two-thirds of their whole life. And even if you were not that young when you got here, two decades as an open source project is really a cause for celebration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not in that group that has been here forever. I showed up for the first time in 2009, as a community organizer, self-sponsored, and I learned so much about myself as a person and as a leader while I was doing that. So when I arrived as a sponsored contributor in 2015, I already knew exactly what made this work so fulfilling for me was these three things:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ability to lend a hand in those moments where I wish someone had lent a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the delight of seeing people&#8217;s first successes and the joy of watching them grow over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third was a chance to be part of something great, which turned out to be something greater; greater than me or you or a CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is still at the heart of what I feel I get out of the WordPress project. But it has also grown substantially in my seven years as a sponsored contributor. I now also love how we as a community of contributors get to foster a better way to lead and a better way to collaborate. And through those things help people find a way to have a better life. Not just through WordPress, the CMS, but through WordPress, the people, and WordPress, the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when I think of what I want for WordPress in its 19th year, so that we can head with confidence and dignity into our 20th year, it is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to remember that you are not alone here. People come together in the world often because of a shared location. But WordPress fosters this beautiful experience of bringing us together because of what we care about. Whether you care about PHP standards, diversity in technology, helping people with their first big wins, making WordPress more secure. I mean, if what you care about is being able to write the most arcane and complex apps on top of WordPress that the world has ever seen. Then there are others out there who want to do that with you, too. We have so many things to connect about. And fortunately, we support a great piece of software for getting our thoughts out in the world. Take some time to see who else shares your thoughts and potentially learn a bit about the view from the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of the other side, I also want us to approach our discussions as the US versus the Problem TM. WordPress may be 20 years old, and we may stand on the shoulders of giants, but right now, the people who are here you, you are explorers and creators and guides toward the best possible future for WordPress. The tension that we witness between teams is always about the best possible answers for the people who use our software. It is about securing the freedoms of the open web for everyone who comes after us whether they know they need those freedoms or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I want us to expand our reasons for doing this at all. If you are a member of the community of contributors, We frequently talk about how we give back because WordPress gave to us. Or if you are part of a Five for the Future group. You have heard that companies who have experienced success because of WordPress should commit 5% of their resources back to the project to ensure WordPress&#8217; long-term success. But the reason that I keep doing this, and hopefully a new reason for you to keep doing this is that we can take part in securing opportunities for future users of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I want WordPress to be the best CMS. Yes, I want this community to be vibrant and engaged. Yes, I want WordPress to be a shining beacon of how to work remotely. And I want all of that because I know it is our careful and tireless stewardship of this project that lets us continue to lend a hand in those moments where people wish for someone to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my hopes for WordPress in 2022 to move us forward into WordPress of the future. I hope you all will come with me and we can continue our journey together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for listening. I&#8217;m Josepha Haden and this is the WP Briefing. See you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12043\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"WordPress 5.9 RC 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:43:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"RC2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"The second Release Candidate (RC2) for WordPress 5.9 is available!

Testing for bugs is not just a critical part of polishing every release, it is also a great way to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-help\"><strong>How to Help</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/11/30/help-test-wordpress-5-9-features/\">Help test WordPress 5.9 features</a> – a guide to how you can take part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you write in another language other than English?

His fascination with development and learning continued to grow, and he now makes a living using WordPress and the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to discover his story, which shows with creativity and determination you can create products and make a living using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"starting-web-building-on-a-phone\"><strong>Starting web building on a phone</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=350%2C426&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Collins Agbonghama headshot photo\" class=\"wp-image-11920\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=246%2C300&amp;ssl=1 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins began his exploration of the internet while attending Secondary School in Nigeria, or High School as it is known in some other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend at the school had a simple mobile phone which could browse the internet. Collins had his first introduction to the World Wide Web through access to this device. He became hooked by reading headlines on a sports site about a famous English Premier League Football Club, Chelsea, a soccer team which he has long supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Being a very inquisitive person, I wanted to learn how the web works as well as have my own website. I was able to buy a classic mobile phone through the menial jobs I did after school,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first website was a wapsite or Wireless Application Protocol site optimized for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He took to Google to learn how to actually build a site. He discovered he needed something called an ‘email address’ to sign-up for site builders. Google Search came to the rescue again, and he created the first email account for his first website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A desire for a website was the catalyst for further learning, starting with HTML and CSS from an online provider. His interest in building sites with more advanced tools grew, and then he came across WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using his savings, he bought the cheapest hosting plan from a local Nigerian web host. He installed WordPress and started writing tutorials for a mobile device platform. He built the site, created the lessons, and started his entry into WordPress all on a mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to him having the confidence to start building sites for others, and he was able to earn a small income from that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I couldn’t go to the university because of my precarious financial situation. I continued to do menial jobs during the day and started learning PHP in the evenings and at night using my mobile phone via online learning platforms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was later able to get an old laptop, which helped him access ebooks to learn more and practice his coding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen to share this learning, he started blogging about what he was learning on his website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I later took up a job teaching children at a school primarily because I got tired of the menial jobs and wanted to earn enough to take care of my internet data plan. After a while, I became fairly proficient in PHP and even took up a job to build a school management system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"using-wordpress-to-make-a-living\"><strong>Using WordPress to make a living</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins’ blog wasn’t making money through advertisements, but he discovered opportunities to write tutorials for other platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I started writing PHP and WordPress development tutorials and got paid a few hundred dollars per article. In Nigeria, that’s quite a lot of money. I was able to improve the life and wellbeing of my family and myself,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting into a higher education program to study computer science, his life dramatically changed. He decided to stop writing and began to focus on building and selling WordPress plugins.&nbsp;His first one was a user and profile plugin for WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thankfully, after a year, it started making enough revenue for me to live pretty comfortably here in Nigeria because the cost of living here is relatively low,” he said</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Collins has several plugins which have given him a sustainable source of income. He’s also a Core and Translation volunteer contributor to the WordPress.org Open Source project. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I am thankful for WordPress because without it, I’m really not sure I would have been able to live a decent quality life. <br>Who knows what would have become of me?</p><cite>Collins Agbonghama</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am also thankful for the community. I have made lots of friends that have been very supportive and helpful in my journey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I tell people, life won’t give you what you want. You demand from life what you want. You make these demands by being determined and never giving up on your dreams and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you are poor, perhaps because you came from a humble and poor background, it is not your fault.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ages and ages ago, when I first started this podcast, someone basically requested that Matt and I do a duet for the last podcast of the year. A Christmas carol duet; him on the saxophone and me on voice. I obviously did not get that coordinated I don&#8217;t even know why I said obviously. I&#8217;ll tell you right now I did not get that coordinated. I was a very busy lady this year. So I don&#8217;t have a Matt on saxophone. Still, I did think that maybe it might be nice just for me to sing a teensy little Christmas carol for you all just because it seems especially poignant the words this year, especially after the 2020, 2021 COVID, all the things and trying to get back in person. So I&#8217;m going to sing you all one little verse from <em>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>01:35 <em>Singing</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your heart be light</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be out of sight</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make the Yuletide gay</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be miles away</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, my friends, that was from my heart to yours if you happened to listen. If you skipped a few seconds to get through it, which I would totally understand, that is also fine. But I did want to just kind of wrap up the year to let you all know that I am so incredibly grateful for all of the people who show up for the WordPress project to make it a success. I have made so many friends and wonderful acquaintances throughout my time here with the WordPress project. And especially in my three years as the project&#8217;s Executive Director. You all have put a lot of trust in me and a lot of faith. And I know that we have gotten so much done together in the last few years. And I am equally sure that we&#8217;re going to get so much done in the years to come. And so thank you all so much for your continued work with WordPress and the way that you just bring your best at all times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other little thanks I want to give. Over the course of this year, I&#8217;ve had an excellent team that works with me on this podcast. I have editing and design folks and people who&#8217;ve joined me here and there, folks who helped me with my production. So big thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dustinhartzler/\">Dustin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beafialho/\">Bea</a>, I realize your name is Beatriz in the actual credits, but I call you Bea, and so thank you. Also, a huge thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">Chloé</a>, who does all of our production and wrangling every couple of weeks. A big round of applause and kudos to that tiny but tough team that helps me get this all done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s to go on top of the general thanks to the WordPress project. And if you all are celebrators, I hope you have a wonderful holiday season.

The hybrid event took place in New York City with a small audience (proof of vaccination required). As Matt said, &#8220;we had people join by plane, train, and automobile.&#8221; Those who didn’t make the trek to the live event watched the livestream from wherever they call home, all around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an exciting moment for the WordPress community which also celebrated its first in-person WordCamp in Sevilla, Spain, after a lengthy hiatus for in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">view the full recording</a>, complete with captions and transcripts on WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was thrilling to see so many meetup organizers host watch parties worldwide. Twenty-eight watch parties were held across eleven countries, with more than 300 RSVPs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to past State of the Word events, Matt covered a broad range of topics. This year was no different. WordPress’ past, present, and future were in the spotlight, with highlights on the growth of the contributors, language translations, recent release milestones, and educational initiatives, to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audience members and livestreamers alike viewed product demos showcasing upcoming features that will be the hallmark of WordPress 5.9, such as full site editing, block patterns, global styling options, and enhanced image controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt took the opportunity to remind everyone of the WordPress roadmap which includes native multi-lingual support and real-time collaborative site editing. He also pointed out that anyone can contribute to WordPress’ progress through a number of different initiatives ranging from creating new features and testing to helping spread the word and educate others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt emphasized the way that open source software gets better by reminding everyone that “The more people that use a program like WordPress, the better it gets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broader topics covering the tech landscape including web3, merger and acquisition activity, as well as the growth and support of open source software, rounded out the energetic presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-hour multimedia presentation was followed by an interactive <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2021-qa/\">question and answer</a> session where Matt fielded questions that were submitted ahead of the event, as well as questions from the livestream and studio audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discover everything that was covered by <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">watching the official event recording</a> and join the ongoing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ILoveWP\">#ILoveWP conversation on Twitter</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>dansoschin</a> for review and edits! </em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 5.9 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/wordpress-5-9-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 20:19:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11835\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WordPress 5.9 Beta 3 is now available for testing.

Read on for some highlights.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"full-site-editing\"><strong><strong>Full Site Editing</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"styles-interface\">The <strong>Styles Interface</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine all the features that went live in 5.8 with those making their entrance in 5.9, and you get <strong>Full Site Editing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formerly known as Global Styles, the Styles Interface lets you interact directly with your blocks and elements right in the WordPress Admin. From typography to color palettes, this cohesive design interface means a design change—even a dramatic one—can happen without a theme switch. <strong>No code needed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"theme-json\"><strong>Theme.json</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in WordPress 5.8, theme.json has been improved to enable features and default styles for your site and its blocks. With 5.9, theme.json can support child themes and the duotone treatment. Coordinate layers of style with theme.json, taking the weight off of your theme’s required CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features supported by theme.json include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Border:</strong> color, style, and width augment the border-radius property that landed in 5.8.</li><li><strong>Flex layouts:</strong> Block Gap support, courtesy of spacing.blockGap.</li><li><strong>Typography:</strong> font families, font style, font weight, text decoration, and text transform.</li><li><strong>Images</strong>: Duotones.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-new-navigation-block\"><strong>A New Navigation Block</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the most intuitive way to build navigation: the Navigation Block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the features that need testing the most:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Responsive menu options you can turn off, have always on, or opt to use only for small screens.</li><li>Built-in keyboard accessibility.&nbsp; For accessibility, for speed, or both.</li><li>Add extra blocks like Search and Site Icon blocks (and customize them to your liking).</li><li>Submenu items with styling options.</li><li>Horizontal or vertical alignment.</li><li>Reusable navigation? Even across themes? Yes. Because the Navigation Block you build gets saved as a custom post type.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-better-gallery-block\"><strong>A Better Gallery Block</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could treat single images in your Gallery Block the same way you treat the Image Block? <strong>Now you can.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Make every image in your gallery different from the next, with inline cropping or a duotone and change layouts with the ease of drag and drop. With the improved gallery block, every image is its own Image block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One thing to note: </strong>Have you built a plugin or theme on the Gallery Block functionality?<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/20/gallery-block-refactor-dev-note/\"> Be sure to review this Dev Note, which details what you need to do for compatibility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"focused-template-part-mode\"><strong>Focused Template Part Mode</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building template parts can take a level of focus all its own because you’re making decisions for the entire site. So WordPress 5.9 adds a focus mode that shows you only the part you’re working on right now (and you can get back to the regular view with a keystroke).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"block-pattern-directory\"><strong>Block Pattern Directory</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Pattern Directory</a> offers a range of prebuilt block patterns, from a couple of blocks that show an image and text, to an entire page layout with columns and sections. Since the 5.8 release, the directory has become a hub for exploratory UI and patterns, taking submissions and offering them to the community. So now, your creation can help other people build out their perfect site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"twenty-twenty-two-default-theme\"><strong>Twenty Twenty-Two Default Theme</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A whole new way of building WordPress themes.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.9 introduces features that make Full Site Editing possible, including <strong>the first default block theme</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using minimal CSS, theme styles reside in theme.json so that you can configure them in the Styles interface of the WordPress Admin. Make this theme take on its own personality site-wide, with a wide array of color schemes, type combinations, page templates, premade components (forms), and image treatments to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more-improvements-and-updates\"><strong>More Improvements and Updates</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you love to blog? New tweaks to the publishing flow let you add new posts just seconds after hitting Publish on your latest post.</li><li>List View lets you drag and drop content as easily as you could always cruise through it – and collapse entire sections – so you can concentrate on a task or get the bigger picture.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33955\">The Buttons and Social icons blocks now absorb</a> and display their parent block’s toolbar controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43700\">Choose your language</a> on the login screen.</li><li>More <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33868\">performance improvements</a> (i.e., speed).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Props to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/priethor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>priethor</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/psykro/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>psykro</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>annezazu</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellofromtonya/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>hellofromtonya</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidbaumwald/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>davidbaumwald</a>, and <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/rmartinezduque/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>rmartinezduque</a> for their research and copy.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11584\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 08 Apr 2022 13:38:46 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 07:59:59 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172008\";}','no');

It feels like a theme you would use as a starting point to build your own thing. It will not have enough personality for everyone to give it a shot. However, for others, a base layout to customize is what they might be looking for. I genuinely love starter-type themes because they are often ideal for client work or DIY users who want to take control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Grigora has a feature that only a handful of existing block themes in the WordPress directory can boast. It includes a sidebar in its default output:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post view with sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>There is one quirk with the sidebar. For whatever reason, the theme author specifically targets the last Group block in it, adding 30px of left padding. Any blocks added above it do not share the same offset from the content area as shown in the screenshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sidebar-less designs are increasingly becoming the norm, especially in an age where most people browse the web through mobile devices. However, several Tavern readers have asked if I would share some block themes with sidebars. Grigora&#8217;s implementation matches with how I would go about building a similar layout (aside from the weird padding issue, of course).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For once, someone built a theme that did not automatically load all 90+ of my pages in the default nav menu. Almost every time I activate a new block theme that does this, it is broken on the front end. For this break from the insanity, I can only thank the developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most disappointing thing about Grigora was that its default design did not match its screenshot from WordPress.org. Anyone who has ever installed a theme from the directory knows that this is not unusual. Theme authors have asked for better tools to address this issue for years, and block templates and global styles are the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no longer any limits on offering the experience that users expect when they see that pretty screenshot that caught their eye in the first place. Instead of the nicely laid-out design, users are presented with the typical list of blog posts. And, there are no instructions on how to recreate the screenshot&#8217;s look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I managed to piece something together with the theme&#8217;s &#8220;Blank&#8221; page template and a couple of patterns. The testimonial pattern was easy to locate, but I could not find one that matched the header. The closest was &#8220;Parallax Centered Transparent Header.&#8221; However, I had to customize it to get something more closely aligned with the screenshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Recreating the theme&#8217;s screenshot.\n\n\n\n<p>Such fiddling should not be a prerequisite to getting the same design as the screenshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grigora has over a dozen patterns, but where it really shines is its custom block styles. I had a lot of fun tinkering with Heading options:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing Heading block styles.\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the theme registers 98 styles for users to choose from. Some of these are duplicates used on similar block types. However, it is still an impressive range of style options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following screenshot shows some of its Button and List block styles:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting Button and List blocks with custom styles.\n\n\n\n<p>I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Grigora. I see a ton of potential for it to be a rock-solid base theme. All the elements are in place, but several quirks are scattered throughout. Every time I think I have encountered them all, another pops up. A few are because WordPress 5.9 lacks some necessary block controls. However, others are easy to address with the existing toolset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the spacing between blocks in the right column of the following pattern is all over the place:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Pattern with inconsistent spacing.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can adjust it with the margin design option for each block or by wrapping it in a Group and modifying its spacing. However, that should be handled by the theme out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the issues I encountered with Grigora Blocks revolved around fixable spacing hiccups. Outside of that, the content width was a tad wide for the 18px font size deployed by the theme. Bumping that up to 19px, even 20px, or reducing the width would be ideal for users who will be writing long-form content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I expect this theme to only get better as user feedback rolls in and the author experiments more with WordPress&#8217;s design controls. A bit more quality control and testing will make it a nicer base for building all sorts of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I tested Grigora against WordPress 5.9 because some of its pattern designs were slightly off with the latest Gutenberg plugin active. Even a mere few months after the last major WordPress release, the editor already feels dated. For those who have not tested the most recent Gutenberg updates, I recommend doing so. The experience is much improved across the board, and I expect you to be pleasantly surprised when 6.0 launches.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 08 Apr 2022 03:03:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Post Status: What Agencies are Looking for in Your Code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95723\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/what-agencies-are-looking-for-in-your-code/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12524:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Don\'t show up without trousers for an interview. As ridiculous as that advice might seem, there are many situations where you need to be careful not to overlook crucial elements that would help secure a job within an agency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, when everyone is desperately looking for developers and there\'s a shortage of skilled WordPress specialists, recruiting the right person is crucial. Having been in the WordPress Community and ecosystem for over a decade, I want to share my thoughts on finding and hiring the right people — or how to find the perfect place to pursue a career in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I want to show you what mature WordPress agencies should be looking for in your code as a developer and how to increase your chances of getting the job of your dreams.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is natural that with the enormous success of WordPress, the ecosystem keeps growing, and a lot of new businesses and agencies have appeared. Some smaller agencies with a marketing focus were often built up by non-developers and then struggle to know who to hire. On the other side of the coin, many applicants, maybe new to the industry or starting with WordPress, are a bit lost and could use guidance on what helps their application stand out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why I want to show you what mature WordPress agencies should be looking for in your code as a developer and how to increase your chances of getting the job of your dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-high-standards\">High Standards </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to remember that this is &#8220;Enterprise-level Code&#8221; we\'re talking about. Even if the client often sees the working, visible result and not the underlying code (something they don\'t generally care about until there is a problem), the code must always be up to the highest standard. It will undoubtedly come back to haunt you if you write code without attention to quality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code quality impacts maintainability and scalability at its core, ultimately affecting the application\'s value and total cost of ownership. If you are building applications that will be around a long time or experience high traffic, low-quality code will result in a cascade of problems and follow-up issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Showing your work and your growth may mean showing how you dealt with a serious bug or vulnerability. We\'ve been through it, and we want to know how you\'ve fared in the same situation. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-improvement-over-time\">Improvement Over Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the many reasons agencies have public software projects is that they are the backbone of Open Source. It also helps them keep an eye on the scope and software quality. It shows the evolution of the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we produce good code, someone else can step in and help, grab a fraction of it, improve, build upon, or extend it. Agencies and other employers want to see code that is easy, readable, and expandable. That is why it\'s essential to keep in mind DRY (Don\'t Repeat Yourself). Test your code well, improve something, and see if it still works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to show growth — how you\'ve evolved in your coding skills. Even our best developers look into their old code and recognize that there are better ways to do it now because techniques and languages are constantly evolving. The old version of their software is still functional, but it has evolved and the developer has too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone who develops can improve their skills if they learn to refactor, sleep, repeat. If we don\'t see evidence of improvement, why would we hire you?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fluency with Their Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to look into not just things like tooling but also the coding patterns your prospective employer is using and familiarize yourself with them. Patterns are there for a reason. They are tried and tested and have good results, making it easier to write and understand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the difference between a dull or sharp ax: both will get the job done, but it is faster and safer to go with the more finely honed and better-maintained tool. If you evolve with your tools, you can work faster and better because you are trained and skilled in using them. You should be able to show this to demonstrate your value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fluency with the WordPress API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key step in evaluating developers is their use of the WordPress API when it\'s available. When we review code from job applicants at Inpsyde, we look to see if they use WordPress fluently as their framework. If they do, this shows they are using the tools most suited to the job. This helps keep complexity to a minimum because WordPress has already solved a lot of problems. Developers don\'t need to reinvent the wheel if they know the code. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-code-that-s-relevant-to-the-job\">Code That\'s Relevant to the Job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we see old code, and we don\'t judge it because code is constantly evolving. This could mean the person also has grown. It is a great way to see where the person\'s learning journey was in the past. However, it <em>is</em> a problem if we only see code that\'s unrelated to the position being applied for. This requires us to follow up and request proof that you can adapt to the job requirements. If you showcase your &#8220;shop window,&#8221; make sure it is correct, spruce it up, and eliminate the spider webs. This is your calling card and one of the main things we check. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-no-god-objects\">No God Objects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the thing — we love to see code. We can tell from your code if you are — or aren\'t — interested in growing as a developer. There is a tendency among developers to create &#8220;God Objects.&#8221; In Object-Oriented Programming, this is an object that references a large number of types, has too many unrelated methods, or does both of these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons we recommend lots of testing is because it makes you hate God Objects. The God Object knows and does too much. There is a reason it’s called an Anti-Pattern that &#8220;smells.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about the concept of &#8220;Separation of Concerns&#8221; is that it splits tasks that the code does into separate parts that can be abstracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-uppercase-p\">The Uppercase &#8216;P\'</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoever doesn\'t write uppercase P in the WordPress world doesn\'t have a clue. It is the one thing you could be shunned, and there\'s not much you could say in your defense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8216;P\' doesn\'t make you code faster or slower, but it highlights your closeness and connection to the WordPress community. No uppercase &#8216;P\' means you don\'t care about the WordPress community. That makes sense if you\'re coming from outside the WordPress world. But when you\'re applying for a role in an agency that is in that world and cares about the community, already being part of it gives you an edge over everyone who isn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would argue the &#8216;P\' doesn\'t define the quality of the programmer, but 90% of the time, it\'s a good measure. It isn\'t absolute. Someone could still use a God Object even if they use an uppercase &#8216;P\' — but there are other ways to show your participation in the WordPress community, and these matter too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-source-code-not-just-a-cv\">Source Code, Not Just a CV</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our way of reviewing CVs is not aimed at evaluating coding ability. It\'s impossible to know who can code well based on a CV. Although CVs help us understand what you\'ve done and estimate the complexity of your experience, it won\'t clarify how up-to-date you are in your skills and coding fluency. This could be a problem for a person who wants to return to work with WordPress. If they have been away for some time, it may feel like a totally different development ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it\'s a common practice, don\'t send URLs to websites as proof of your work. Even if we can verify it\'s your code there, what we can see on the front end reveals very little information about the application code and how you built it. It might look and work well, but we want to look under the hood and take the engine apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking for a description of what a developer did and learned in the past. We often see the use of different frameworks and can determine from that what other skills they might have. Working for years only in WordPress does not guarantee that someone is skilled. That\'s why we rely on checking source code to decide the next steps with a candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-you-ve-dealt-with-vulnerabilities\">How You\'ve Dealt with Vulnerabilities </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thought of getting a Security Exploit notification from the WordPress plugin directory can make anyone break out into a cold sweat. Well, sit down and breathe. We got through it and so will you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our case, we had a problem with random strings that weren\'t random enough. We needed to add randomness, so we did. Can you show a case where you dealt with something similar? Have you patched a major bug or vulnerability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a duty to your users. When you know you have a problem, it doesn\'t matter how trivial it might seem. You must solve it. If this hasn\'t happened to you, it will. How would you respond? If we\'re going to hire you, we want to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Always Learning — Together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we are working in Open Source, there is always a possibility to learn — together. There are always new ways of learning all the time. Now we have videos, Meetups, WordCamps, and <a href=\"http://learn.wordpress.org\">learn.wordpress.org</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We exist and have grown thanks to those who came before. We are acutely aware we are standing on the shoulders of giants. As an agency that hires developers, we\'re not looking for individual giants. We\'re looking for developers who can help us become the shoulders for others to stand on. </p>\n\n\n#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-blocks-info-box-link-wrap{border-radius:20px;background:#ffffff;padding-top:24px;padding-right:24px;padding-bottom:24px;padding-left:24px;border-top-width:5px;border-right-width:5px;border-bottom-width:5px;border-left-width:5px;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-blocks-info-box-link-wrap:hover{border-color:#eeeeee;background:#ffffff;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kadence-info-box-image-inner-intrisic-container{max-width:100px;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kadence-info-box-image-inner-intrisic-container .kadence-info-box-image-intrisic{padding-bottom:100%;width:400px;height:0px;max-width:100%;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-info-svg-icon, #kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-info-svg-icon-flip, #kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-blocks-info-box-number{font-size:50px;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-blocks-info-box-media{color:#444444;background:#ffffff;border-color:#eeeeee;border-radius:200px;border-top-width:5px;border-right-width:5px;border-bottom-width:5px;border-left-width:5px;padding-top:20px;padding-right:20px;padding-bottom:20px;padding-left:20px;margin-top:0px;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-blocks-info-box-media .kadence-info-box-image-intrisic:not(.kb-info-box-image-ratio) img{border-radius:200px;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-blocks-info-box-link-wrap:hover .kt-blocks-info-box-media{color:#444444;background:#ffffff;border-color:#eeeeee;}#kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8 .kt-blocks-info-box-title{padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;margin-top:5px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;}\n<div id=\"kt-info-box_aaaac1-a8\" class=\"wp-block-kadence-infobox\"><a class=\"kt-blocks-info-box-link-wrap info-box-link kt-blocks-info-box-media-align-left kt-info-halign-left\"><div class=\"kt-blocks-info-box-media-container\"><div class=\"kt-blocks-info-box-media kt-info-media-animate-none\"><div class=\"kadence-info-box-image-inner-intrisic-container\"><div class=\"kadence-info-box-image-intrisic kt-info-animate-none\"><div class=\"kadence-info-box-image-inner-intrisic\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kb-RD-_W_400x400.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Windisch\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"kt-info-box-image wp-image-95735\" /></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"kt-infobox-textcontent\"><h2 class=\"kt-blocks-info-box-title\">Robert Windisch</h2><p class=\"kt-blocks-info-box-text\">Robert is co-founder and CIO of Inpsyde GmbH.

The event was recorded and is now <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/sWYrIQbI\">available on WordPress.tv</a> and embedded below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is set to include approximately 400 updates and 500 bug fixes. Gutenberg lead architect Matías Ventura led the tour of the upcoming release, demonstrated how the style switcher works, and touched on additional templates coming in 6.0 (author, date, category, tag, taxonomy), as well as the Webfonts API. He also showed how many of the editor improvements work, including cross text multi-selection, quick insertion of links, appenders, consistent styling between buttons, and improvements to list view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event was very casual, not a polished marketing style showcase. Contributors were transparent about the loose ends that are still visible and gave viewers a feel for the direction of the project and what they have in mind for future iterations of these features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 120 people joined the broadcast for an interactive Q&amp;A that happened throughout the walkthrough. The event was so successful that WordPress marketing team contributor Dan Soschin said they are considering making these types of live product demonstrations more frequent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Based on the positive experience among the panelists and attendees, I believe it is feasible that another walkthrough could take place closer to the release date as well as become a regular part of the communications cycle for future releases,&#8221; Soschin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In future iterations, alternative platforms may be explored, such as a live stream service so the event can be viewed on Youtube, for example.

But spambots, internet trolls, and scammers can derail the discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are ways to automatically filter out unwanted comments. With the right tools and safety measures, you can reap the benefits of WordPress comments — without any of the drawbacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll take a close look at WordPress comment blocklists and why they’re important. We’ll then show you how to build a complete comment-blocking system in five steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2374\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2>An introduction to WordPress comment blocklists (and why you need them)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad language, spam links, and irrelevant comments can devalue your site. To keep your comment section engaging and positive, you may want to consider creating a blocklist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blocklist is a list of offensive words, potential link spam, controversial phrases, and other unwanted content. Every comment posted to your site will need to pass through this filter. WordPress will then examine the comment’s content, as well as the poster’s username, the associated site title, URL, email address, and IP address.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If any of this content contains a blocklisted word or phrase, then WordPress won’t post the comment to your site automatically. Depending on how you’ve configured your blocklist, this comment may be placed in your WordPress moderation queue. This is a section of the WordPress dashboard where you can manually review all flagged comments. You can then either publish them to your site or send them to the Trash folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you might specify words that will result in a comment being sent directly to the Trash. This can ensure that you’re not wasting precious time reviewing every bad comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this blocklist is unlikely to catch every harmful comment, it can be an effective way to block the majority of unwanted content, or the most obvious examples of spam and harassment. This can minimize the time and effort required to maintain a pleasant, engaging, and informative comment section.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to create a robust WordPress comment blocklist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, WordPress has everything you need to create a comment blocklist. However, it’s your responsibility to build this list and keep it up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the best results, you may want to use this built-in blocklist in combination with a few other tricks, techniques, and plugins. Let’s see how you can create a more robust WordPress comment blocklist, in five steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #1: Identify harmful words</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to creating an effective blocklist is identifying the words and phrases that you want to block. Some may immediately spring to mind, like bad language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a complete list of every single harmful or offensive word can be a challenge. Fortunately, there are people who have already done all of the hard work for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend taking a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress Comment Blacklist</a>. This resource contains over 45,000 phrases, patterns, and keywords commonly used by spammers and comment bots.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Every website is unique and attracts its own unwanted comments. For this reason, you may benefit from examining the content that your site is already flagging as spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress automatically conducts several tests on comments before publishing them to your pages and posts. If a comment fails, it will be added to a moderation queue to await your approval.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To view your queue, navigate to <strong>Comments → Spam</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>By examining these, you may be able to pick up words or phrases that are commonly used in spam comments on your site. These are ideal candidates to add to your blocklist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do identify an unwanted message, then it’s smart to add its site title, URL, and email address to your blocklist. This can make it more difficult for this person or bot to target your site in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #2: Use the WordPress built-in blocklist</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress comes with everything you need to create a simple blocklist. To build this list, navigate to <strong>Settings → Discussion</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>On this screen, scroll to the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong> section. To start, you may want to place a comment in your moderation queue if it contains multiple links. Spammy profiles will often add several URLs to their comments, so this can be an easy way to pinpoint suspicious content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Some people may abuse the comment system by using it for self promotion. For this reason, you may want to consider holding back all comments that feature a link,&nbsp;even if it’s just a single URL.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After entering this information, you can add all of your blocklisted words to the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong> section. You can either type them into this box or use copy/paste, but you must only enter one word or phrase per line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, WordPress will hold comments back for moderation if they contain these words in their content, author name, URL, email, IP address, or the browser’s user agent string. You can review this moderation queue at any time by navigating to <strong>Comments → Spam</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #3: Create a disallowed list</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some blocklisted words are more forgivable than others. For example, you may flag all comments that feature your competitor’s name. This gives you a chance to review this content to ensure that it’s not promoting the competition’s products or services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, there are scenarios where this content may benefit your site. For instance, a poster might compare you favorably to your biggest competitor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, there are some words that you’ll never want to appear on your website. This often includes derogatory or discriminatory terms. If there’s zero chance of you approving these comments, then you may want to send them straight to <strong>Trash</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To bypass the moderation queue, scroll to the <strong>Disallowed Comment Keys</strong> section. Here, you can enter words and phrases that will result in a comment being forwarded directly to your site’s <strong>Trash</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just bear in mind that WordPress does match partial words and variations of blocklisted words. Therefore, it may incorrectly flag content as spammy or offensive. For this reason, you may want to add the majority of your words to the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong> section. This gives you an opportunity to identify legitimate comments that have been caught in the filter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #4: Level up your WordPress comment blocklist with Akismet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spambots, malicious third parties, and even internet trolls are constantly coming up with new and ingenious ways to trick comment blocklists. Therefore, it may help to have an advanced comment filtering plugin in your corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">Akismet plugin</a> maintains its own database of unwanted words, plus thousands of blocklisted IPs, URLs, phrases, and links. Since this database is built into the plugin, you don’t have to download or configure a list manually. Akismet continuously adds to its database, so you&#8217;ll have up-to-date protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many WordPress sites come with Akismet installed by default. If it isn’t, you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">download it for free</a> from the official WordPress repository. As soon as it’s up and running, Akismet will prompt you to create an account.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the plugin was installed on your site by default, but isn’t yet enabled, navigate to <strong>Plugins → Installed Plugins</strong>, locate Akismet, and click on <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This launches a page where you can purchase an Akismet license. The Akismet team also offers a “pay what you can” model for personal use.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After purchasing a license and verifying your email address, navigate to <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti-Spam</strong>. You can now click on <strong>Manually enter an API key</strong>. When prompted, type or copy/paste the API Key that Akismet sent to the email associated with your account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately, Akismet will start moderating your comment section, but there are a few simple settings that you can configure. To do this, navigate to <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti-spam</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you can change the strictness level. If you receive a large number of comments, or experience a spike in <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/12/how-to-stop-comment-spam-in-wordpress/\">comment spam</a>, you may want to give Akismet the power to silently discard the worst offenders. This can make your comment queue more manageable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #5: Block access to <em>wp-comments-post.php</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most legitimate visitors will read a post before leaving a comment. This means they’ll have loaded <em>comments.php</em>, which is your blog’s comment template. When this person clicks on <strong>Submit</strong>, WordPress will run the <em>wp-comments-post.php</em> processing file, which is located in the root directory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, spambots typically target <em>wp-comments.post.php</em> directly and bypass your <em>comments.php</em> file altogether. In this scenario, the comments are sent from an HTTP referrer and not from your domain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, you may want to block requests for <em>wp-comments-post.php</em> that are not sent directly from your domain. This can immediately reduce the amount of comment spam that you receive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent bots from accessing <em>wp-comments-post.php</em> directly, connect to your site using a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client, like <a href=\"https://filezilla-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FileZilla</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, download your <em>.htaccess</em><strong> </strong>file. On your local computer, open this file in a text editor and add the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>RewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} wp-comments-post\\.php\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !(.*)example\\.com(.*) &#091;OR]\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^-?$\nRewriteRule .* http://%{REMOTE_ADDR}/ &#091;R=301,L]</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Just make sure to replace “example.com” with your own domain. You can now save this file, and re-upload it to your server.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating an effective WordPress comment blocklist&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a website owner, attracting lots of comments and engagement may seem like the ultimate goal. However, without a comment moderation system in place, this dream can quickly turn into a nightmare, especially if you attract the attention of scammers and spambots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s quickly recap how to create a robust WordPress comment blocklist:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Identify harmful words.</li><li>Use the WordPress built-in blocklist.</li><li>Create a Disallowed List.</li><li>Level up your WordPress comment blocklist using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">Akismet plugin</a>.</li><li>Block access to <em>wp-comments-post.php</em>.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress enables you to create a robust blocklist. If you want to ensure that your comment section is an enjoyable and safe place to be, then Akismet has everything you need to take your WordPress comment blocklist to the next level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/plans/\">Get Akismet spam protection for your WordPress site</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress comment blocklist FAQs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should now have a robust comment blocklist in place, but you may still have some questions. Let’s look at some of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you remove words from a WordPress blocklist?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress does match partial words and variations of blocklisted words. This means that you may need to adjust your blocklist if it’s incorrectly flagging content as spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To remove an item from your blocklist, navigate to <strong>Settings → Discussion</strong>. Then, scroll to the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong> section. You can now delete the keywords that you no longer want to block, and click on <strong>Save Changes.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, there’s a chance you may have added these words or phrases to your <strong>Disallowed Comment Keys </strong>section. All comments that contain these words are sent straight to the Trash folder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been experiencing issues with partial word matching and variations, then you may want to consider moving these items from your disallowed list to the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong> section. This will give you the opportunity to review these comments in your moderation queue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I use a WordPress blocklist to block links to specific websites or email addresses?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many scenarios in which you may want to block links to a particular website or email address. This may include competitor sites or the contact information of a known spammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To block this content, navigate to <strong>Settings → Discussion. </strong>In the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong> section, enter the emails and links in question. Then, click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Apr 2022 14:26:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 53) — Support Tips For Plugin Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95424\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-excerpt-no-53-support-tips-for-plugin-developers/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31543:\"<h2 id=\"there-is-always-some-space-in-the-wordpress-ecosystem-left-for-developers-dave-rodenbaugh\">&#8220;Settings expectations, communicating well, and being responsive are the top three things you can do to improve your customer support.&#8221; —Dave Rodenbaugh</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, David sits down again with <strong>Dave Rodenbaugh</strong>, founder of <strong>Recapture.io</strong>.

I ran business directory plugin, which you can probably guess what that one is. Um, and then I had some other plugins that never really went very far went anywhere. So they\'re not really worth mentoring mentioning, but now, uh, I run recapture a, an email and SMS marketing for e-commerce specifically, uh, in WordPress, we support WooCommerce, paid memberships, pro restrict content pro easy digital downloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, uh, you know, I have a lot of experience with e-commerce and WordPress and using easy digital downloads. That was the primary way I sold the plugins for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And what you\'re doing now is that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Yes. So recapture is a SASS and that\'s my, that\'s my gig now. So I sold the other plugins in 2020, uh, actually the awesome motive, uh, and they have taken over them and are doing a great job running them ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s, it\'s actually nice to see, you know, you let your baby out of the nest and it flies away and it actually is taking on a new life of its own, which is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It doesn\'t get immediately eaten by another animal. That\'s I feel like I\'ve seen that in nature. Uh, who else besides yourself is part of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> So when I was doing the, uh, the classifieds and business directory plugin, I had. One time I had up to two or three other developers that were working on that. I also had a support person when I sold them to awesome motive, that whole staff went with them, so they could continue to maintain the plugins. And now with recapture, I have a full-time tech lead and a QA person, and then I have a person that\'s helping with sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I sort of do all the rest of the stuff, whatever that looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Why didn\'t you start recapture while you were owning the other plugins or did you start it from scratch?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> I\'m sort of a, an aberration, I think in the WordPress world in general, all of my successful WordPress businesses have not been things that I have started from scratch myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually bought them from other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh, so you bought recapture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> I did. Um, I bought the two plugins originally from a freelance developer and, uh, you know, I took those over and grew them from where she was at with them recapture. I bought it from the, a couple of brothers that were actually doing custom iPhone cases and they built this tool for their stores on Magento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I took it and I was like, oh, well this has some obvious places that you could take it. I can move it to other platforms. I can add more functionality. It was literally just abandoned carts for Magento. That\'s it. So, and you know, the tool itself was well written. It was a very well-documented. It was already set up to be scalable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I saw lots of potential in it. And I bought it and took that. Um, and I kinda liked buying businesses over building things from scratch because. It helps de-risk things. I come with a set of customers that I can already talk to. I come with a product that\'s functioning for those customers and doing something valuable for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve paid me money for that. So these are all things that if you\'re building a product from scratch, you have to validate on your own, you know, how do I find the customers? What is it that they really need? How do I build that in the best way possible? Um, yeah, those are, those are tough things to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\'re building it from scratch or you\'re buying something else you\'ve got to, you\'ve got to do a good job on all of those things in order to make your product grow. So my strategy was to buy things that looked attractive, that I felt were something in my wheelhouse I could really work with and then, you know, make better as a result of my equity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So, did you ever have to rebuild your code base when you acquired the plugins like this or</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> The first two we did do some revamping. Um, and that was a slow thing over time, but I mean, consider how much WordPress changed. I think when I first bought the plugins, it was at WordPress one dot nine. Oh Lord.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I have dirt that\'s younger than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> I know. And so there was. Every major release, there was huge shifts in there that we would have to go in and rip out sections of the plugin that were coded to the old way. Yeah. So, and you know, every, every major release, there was always this bridge that we would build that would be like, okay, here\'s all the stuff that we support for the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had to keep the legacy stuff around for the old. And then you\'d retire that every time you\'d move up another major version. So by the time we got to three, we got rid of all the stuff from one dot nine. And you know, the first time we did that, we definitely made some enemies there. People were angry about that because they were still running old versions of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There wasn\'t that upgrade or die kind of mentality back in 2011, 2012, 2013. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> is there anything that stands out in you as, if you would to compare WordPress and non WordPress businesses, how they would, how would they would stack up against each other pros and cons, that sort of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> No, one thing. I mean, there are definitely some things that kind of stand out that make WordPress businesses very unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, one is the whole plugin and theme model. And the fact that GPL is involved in that, which means that your code is licensed in a way that you, you can\'t really say this is mine and mine alone, and nobody can ever touch it. It\'s not a proprietary closed source model. So that means that, you know, smart competitors can go in and take a look at what you\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copy it, fork it, make their own version of it. In fact, that happened to me with, uh, with business directory plugin, somebody took my plugin, stole, laid, bought all of the, the, um, extensions for it and then forked it and put it up on embado. So, you know, and then I\'ve, you know, attract their sales after that. And they made six figures selling it on vAuto and it was a long time before I ever actually noticed that it was over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause I wasn\'t like, you know, going around and scouring for directory competitors on a marketplace that I wasn\'t even in. But, um, but yeah, I mean, I could have done, they definitely had stolen some images and I could have done a DCMA take down or something like that. But by the time I discovered it, it was so late, it wouldn\'t have mattered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They had already revamped a lot of it internally. So that\'s, that\'s a unique aspect of WordPress that I think. You know, discourages some business owners and it causes other business owners to be super secretive and not disclose their strategies and not disclose their plans. They only show what they have to show everything else they\'ll hide,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> which is the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. I mean, they have to show the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Right, but, or they don\'t, or they don\'t put it in the repo. Like that\'s the other thing they\'ll do. They\'ll keep all of it and put it on their own private sites. So in order for you to download it, you got to pay for it. So, you know, this is, this is the model of definitely some larger companies that are out there at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don\'t they\'ll keep the free plugin. But then all the paid stuff is in a place that\'s totally protected. And that\'s ultimately the model I ended up doing for business directory and AWP, PCP, um, with recapture it\'s different. Cause I\'m a service. So, you know, yeah. I was</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> about to ask you about that because do you think eventually most, um, companies that have a paid plugin in WordPress, maybe most let\'s, let\'s say a good, a larger chunk are going to be migrating to a SASSS model because of some of the reasons we\'ve talked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think I\'m hearing a lot, um, from company owners and plugin developers is like, SASS is if I can just turn this into a SASS or we may be migrating to assess at some point, because you know, they don\'t have to share the code and they have a lot more control over their finances, their customers, and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think that\'s going to be play a larger part in WordPress plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> I think that anybody who can make a SASS will probably start heading that direction. But with that said, There are many plugin and theme businesses in particular that you cannot Salsify. If that is a verb. Um, it is now I absolutely declare that SASSify is now a verb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you, you basically have. To ask yourself, this question is the value that my end user and customer receives. Is that something that is repeatable on a monthly or annual basis? And if it is, then you can probably make that into a SASS model. So like with recapture, my example here is that we\'re doing abandoned cart recovery and generating revenue for e-commerce sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So every month I can hand somebody a report to say, we sent this many emails, we made you this much money as a result of those emails. And here\'s how, what the conversions look like and all these other things. So that\'s a demonstration of ongoing value, but like with my business director, The value was captured right up front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like they would install it, they would configure it, they would set it up and then a year later it wasn\'t like they wanted to pay for the whole thing all over again. It\'s not like they got a new business directory. It\'s not like they got, you know, a totally different UI or a massive upgrade. They just got some minor updates and fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the value is captured mostly upfront instead of on an ongoing basis. And for businesses like that, you\'re not going to Salsify those. You\'re certainly not going to get people, you know, you might try to Salsify it, but I don\'t think you\'re going to get a lot of customers signing up for that. Because they\'re not getting that ongoing value and that\'s the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there\'s like a huge number of WordPress businesses, like themes. It\'s kind of difficult to capture that theme value on an ongoing basis, unless you have, like, I could see for freelancers, you could do theme subscriptions to say, Hey, we\'re going to have 15 themes this year. Next year, we\'re going to have 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, we\'re going to have 45. So we\'re releasing 15 new themes a year. If you\'re building freelance site. Great. Now you want an increasing library of things that you can offer your customers. I could see you. That makes sense in a freelancer paid plan, but for an individual, if I go and buy a theme, I don\'t need a new theme next year or the year after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What about support? Um, and a lot of business models go, you pay, you\'re paying basically. The support in for the maintenance and the bug fixes and that sort of thing. When, when do you think a product becomes mature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Yeah, I, I don\'t know what officially makes something mature. I think there is a tension between bug fixes, new features and customer demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you kind of satiate the customer demand for the new features, and you\'ve gotten to a point where the bug fixes are in. So you\'re not throwing out a new major fix every month then. Yeah. Something like that would end up being mature. So a great example of that might be Yoast SEO, right? You\'re not seeing like huge major new SEO updates coming out every single month that Yoast is having to put out if there\'s a major Google update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, sure. They do an</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> update. I get an email like every other week from them, but I\'m guessing it\'s Google updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> It\'s probably a little stuff in Google updates in there, but yeah, I mean, I would consider that a pretty mature product that, you know, there are some tweaks that go in there and I, you know, I don\'t want to downplay the amount, uh, that the Yoast team puts into that. Cause it\'s huge and SEO is complicated, but it\'s definitely a very mature product because people aren\'t like, Hey, I need you to support this very basic thing out here that nobody\'s ever supported before. Like they\'ve got that stuff covered. They have a lot of complexity in their product, a lot of configuration options, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there\'s like newer stuff. So this might be more or less. Gutenberg blocks that are new and novel that do something that nobody else has ever done before, or that yours is the better one to do this slider or this kind of a layout or whatever. Something like that, that kind of stuff is more cutting edge because Gutenberg is not, well, it\'s getting more mature, but it isn\'t as mature as say other aspects in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Right. I like to remind you, I, like I said, I do have a teenager in high school, so yeah. I\'m the maturity is a subject I\'m somewhat familiar with it. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Yes. Uh, I I\'m, I\'m right there with you, David. I have a teenager. Who\'s almost about to graduate high school and another one coming in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Me too, this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Year. Hold his years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> 17. Yeah. Mine\'s 17 two. And I also have an eighth grader right behind her. So next year I\'ve got two in, at the same time. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> it comes to maturity. Yeah. Some things, some things will mature faster than other. Whereas a developer as a company. I mean that, that\'s, that\'s kinda like a problem you would like to have, because I think before you get to that, you\'re, you\'re so busy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re doing 10 different things at once, especially if you\'re like a freelancer or a solo developer. Um, and you know, I\'ve always been freelance for a very long time before I joined a few companies. So I always come business wise. I always come from the aspect of me starting something myself. Me alone, juggling so many balls in the air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, have you ever had to outsource anything in the early days of capture or now, or any of your businesses? Um, even if it was, um, I don\'t know any, anything from financing or marketing or anything like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Um, yeah, actually I have and outsourcing is super valuable to me at this point because there are certain things where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, you know, there\'s a lot of stuff that I can just do because I\'ve had to do it over the years. I\'ve had no choice. So that means I was part accountant, part marketing person, part janitor, part, um, you know, developer part, customer support, just whatever. So you, you wear all these different hats and you can do all of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the problem is, is that you are the Jack of all trades master of none. Right. And. There are people who are very, very specialized at those things. And at some point making them be the owner of that piece is more valuable. So here\'s an example. So when I bought recapture, I was still freelancing at the time I still had the plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was doing customer support over there and I was still doing product management. And then of course I was doing my own development. And then I had recapture on top of all that. Well, when I bought it , it didn\'t come with a staff. It was just the guy who was the two brothers that were running it. And I bought it from him and nobody came with him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They didn\'t come with a plugin, then they didn\'t come with it. No, they were like, here, it\'s yours. Good luck. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> well, insert my children joke here later, but go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Yes. Uh, so the problem immediately became, I had customers that were asking for new features or bug fixes, and I couldn\'t do any of that stuff just yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I could, if I invested the time, but a lot of it was time sensitive. So initially what I did is I paid one of the brothers that sold it to me to consult on certain things. Cause he could do things the fastest and he was willing to do that. It was part of the contract that we sold. Anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> There\'s usually that coverage period, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Right. But the coverage period is only like 90 days. And I think I had him come and help me for like six months. So he was very nice. And was willing to do that, but it was clear that, you know, I needed more than he was able to give and he didn\'t really want to keep doing it for the longterm. So that\'s when I basically had to like go and outsource to somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was more full-time. So I had, you know, cashflow from recapture itself. So I use that to invest in a developer who is now my tech lead for recapture. And, you know, he\'s been working on it for five years, but basically I made a decision early on, I am not going to do the technical development aspects of this SASS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m going to let somebody else do it. I just, I can\'t do it and this other stuff. So I had to outsource something that was what I chose to outsource and I totally don\'t regret it. He has taken ownership of all that, and it worked out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So, um, so what\'s your tip in terms of how do you know when it\'s time to outsource something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> When is it time to outsource something? So I would say it\'s a combination of, do you have. Some kind of way to pay somebody to do that. So like, if you are, you need income, you brand new, you need to have some kind of income, but it doesn\'t have to be from your project. So here\'s, here\'s, here\'s the caveat. I would say that if you are a freelancer and you are pulling in a nice salary and it more than covers your living expenses and you\'re putting stuff in savings, save that up for awhile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you could use that savings to pay for somebody to out source something while you\'re doing something else. So you can leverage that time, that money in a different way. I always would buy something that was making income so that I could use that income to help hire somebody else. And that way it didn\'t have to come out of my savings personally, cause I already spent the money on the business and I didn\'t want it to spend a second time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the two, two ways that I would end up funding that. But if you are by yourself, you don\'t have that money. You\'re just getting started. Or you\'re kind of new to the whole thing. I would strongly encourage you to just try to wear all those different hats and become that Renaissance person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. It\'s good to know what all those things are because eventually in order for you to outsource it, you have to understand it well enough to tell somebody else exactly what you want. And it\'s hard to do that if you haven\'t had experience in that yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And I imagine too, that it helps. Not that everybody has the luxury of the privilege of this, but it also helps if you are starting brand new with a plugin, the rebuild helps to know if you do have plans on growing that beyond just simply what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because you, the sooner you start some sort of path to some sort of monetization, the faster you can have that money, automotive and buyer gallery, all these others, they have a pro version people pay and that\'s the, those people are actually paying support people to help with the light you know, the repo, The light versions in the repo and the support there that\'s being financed there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I mean, if you\'re starting from zero, um, it\'s charity at that point until, I guess, like you said, you gotta find the money from somewhere. If you get to a certain, certain scale. So what\'s your advice or what\'s your take on how much attention, um, business owners and entrepreneurs should be paying attention to in the WordPress space when it comes to competence?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> That is a fantastic question. And the truth is you can be in one of two camps, so you can either focus solely on your competitors, or you can kind of ignore them. And if you\'re ignoring your competitors, then you should be paying very close attention to your customers. And, oh, I like to mix the two of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like, I\'d like to be aware of what my competitors are doing. Sometimes ideas come out of that sometimes like, Uh, I wasn\'t fully aware of what GDPR was until I saw some of my other competitors posting things. Hey, we\'re going to become GDPR compliant. Hey, GDPR is coming down the pike. Here\'s what you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, what the heck is GDPR? And that\'s when I dug into it and I\'m like, oh boy, I really need to take care of this because this is going to hit. Ton of bricks. So, um, you know, so you should be aware where your competitors at, you know, knowing about your competitors will help you understand what are their pricing models, who are they focused on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like understand who is the right customer for your competitors. But with all that said, you need to like, look at your product, your market, your audience, and. Understand them and talk to them deeply. And by knowing your competitors, you can say, look competitor a over here, they do all of these things, but that\'s too complicated because you\'re not making as much as the, the hundred million dollar a year business that uses this tool over here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re down here. And this is why we\'re better for you because we are simpler. We\'re easier to use. We\'re more focused on this. We have better support, blah, blah, blah, whatever your competitive advantages are, but you can\'t do that. If you don\'t at least understand your competitors, but you know, don\'t focus solely on your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, if all you do is watch what your competitors do, and then repeat that you\'re always going to be behind. You\'re never going to be a market leader in that. So you have to have some awareness, but at the same time, really just be focused on your customers. That\'s my, that\'s my approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> The uniqueness, is that something that you would probably say it would be good advice to, to people who doubt that there\'s any space left in the WordPress ecosystem for whatever product they\'re thinking of?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Uniqueness is, um, there\'s always some space left. So here\'s a great example. If you were to say, what is the most crowded space in WordPress? And, you know, you could probably give several examples, but I\'ll give one of the most obvious ones for. Right. You\'ve got all the different form plugins that are out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You got formidable forms and ACF and, um, the WP forms and ninja forms and, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. There\'s tons and tons. Gravity forms, tons of competitors out there, but yet there are new ones that come out all the time and. There\'s always an opportunity to look at that space with a fresh new approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is like, uh, you know, side bulky from automotive, talked about this when they released their competitor in there. And I\'m pretty sure this is WP forms, but, uh, if I misspoke, it\'s basically the one that Syed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>does</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> the one. It\'s the one with the bear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that\'s the one that basically is focused on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, users that are non-technical and need the most hand-holding and have the most basic set of version of a form functionality available to them. So it\'s, it\'s kind of the polar opposite of like ACF by Brad, Tanard and delicious brains. Right. There\'s is like the most customizable, the most developer friendly, the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything product that you can think of out there. And Syed is the opposite of that. And yet both of them are serving very successful markets and Syed\'s came in like years after all the other competitors were out there and, you know, carved out a new niche. So, you know, if you can look at a very hot space in WordPress, it could be payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be e-commerce, it could be forms. It could be themes. Any of these things. If you could come up with a unique approach that serves an underserved market, then you can be successful out there. Don\'t come in and try to pick like the teeniest tiniest niche ever, and then hope that you can expand from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there\'s no demand, you\'re going to have a hard time making that product work. So it\'s, that\'s my advice is that, you know, pick markets that have energy that are, um, interesting that have customers. Demanding things that are, you know, shuffling money around because that\'s how you\'re going to get your solution out there and find somebody to pay for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each form. Competitor that\'s out there. They all kind of focus on different things. Some of them are focused on certain verticals, some of them on, you know, technical versus non-technical. And you just have to find that thing that you can go in and say, I can offer a solution to this group of people that need this thing that isn\'t served by these other products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a successful, um, that\'s a successful product in a crowded. It\'s been a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> pleasure talking to you and, um, let\'s, let\'s have people figure out where you are on the web to be able to follow you and reach out for more Sage wisdom that you may spew out from time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave Rodenbaugh:</strong> Well, I don\'t know about Sage wisdom, but if anybody does want to talk to me about business, whether it\'s WordPress or non WordPress or SASS, or, uh, anything else, uh, you can reach me on Twitter at Dave Roden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last name is spelled R O D E N B a U G H. Or if you\'re interested in checking out my SASS, that is recapture.io and we support a variety of WordPress platforms that you are likely using if you\'re in the WordPress space. So please come check it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> out. And you\'re also in post status.

I have eagerly awaited each release of the Gutenberg plugin, followed tickets, and chimed in when I could. I have been holding out some sliver of hope for one feature in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to use featured images within a Cover block. That day has finally arrived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, my mission was to create the following layout entirely from the WordPress editor&#8212;no code involved:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This was a part of a set of patterns I had designed for a <em>faux</em> photography portfolio in 2021. The general layout has long been possible in WordPress via the editor. However, it was not dynamic, which meant that each Cover block and its image had to be manually added instead of loading post featured images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, Andrei Draganescu <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39658\">added a pull request that changed everything</a>. It implemented a toggle for the Cover block that allowed it to use the post&#8217;s featured image instead of a static image:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Switching the Cover block to use the featured image.\n\n\n\n<p>Two days ago, that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39658#event-6362139353\">enhancement landed in the Gutenberg plugin</a>. It is expected to ship with version 13.0 next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am unsure why I have been so obsessed with this specific pattern. It is not overly complex. Deep down, perhaps a part of me felt that when WordPress reached the point where I could create it from the editor, we would be at a place where anything was possible. In reality, I know that there is much more ground to cover and features to implement, but this still feels like a significant milestone that should not go unnoticed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the pattern itself is not entirely possible via the editor. As shown in the following screenshot, there are gaps between each of the posts:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Unwanted gaps between posts in the Query Loop block.\n\n\n\n<p>I had to cheat a bit and collapse those with CSS. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39380\">ticket to bring dimension controls</a> to the Query Loop and/or Post Template blocks, but it has yet to be implemented. Theme authors must currently add a custom &#8220;no gap&#8221; block style to address the shortcoming, but the layout is now doable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I may be singularly focused on this particular design, the change opens a world of layout possibilities to theme authors. One style is to use the featured image as a background behind the site and post headers, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Cover block using post featured image when viewing a single post.\n\n\n\n<p>That is now possible directly from the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to recreate it in minutes by editing my active theme&#8217;s single template. I wrapped the Header template part in a Cover, toggled on the featured media switch, and added the Post Title and related blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Cover background with featured image switched on.\n\n\n\n<p>This change will give some freedom to block themers that they have not had since building atop classic WordPress. Users will also be able to make their own tweaks to the output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This enhancement is a win for theme authors and users. However, it also represents another shift that could create new possibilities for blocks in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has a blocks problem. Those added by core alone are starting to overcrowd the inserter UI, and when you add a few plugins in the mix, things can become unwieldy. Many blocks are, essentially, variations on base HTML elements. For example, Post Title is merely a variation on the <code>&lt;h*&gt;</code> element, and WordPress already has a Heading block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These variations duplicate developer efforts, create scenarios where each block supports different features, and often litter the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Birdsong <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37753\">opened a ticket in January</a> that seeks to address this issue. His proposed solution:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Instead of making tons of individual blocks for this sort of thing, it seems like it would be better to create systems for using site/post metadata within existing generic blocks.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusing the post featured image seemed the most obvious starting place. Theme authors have long been clamoring for more control over its output, and the dedicated Post Featured Image block has been lackluster at best. There are tickets to bring the same &#8220;featured cover&#8221; implementation to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35221\">Media &amp; Text</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24660\">Group </a>blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress 6.0 landing next month, we will not see full-scale support for binding dynamic data to more generic blocks. However, it could have implications for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if, instead of plugin authors creating individual blocks, they could merely offer a switch to display content via a custom data source? There are certainly some use cases beyond core WordPress where this could be handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, at least, I am likely to spend the rest of the day tinkering with featured images and Cover blocks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Apr 2022 02:09:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:131:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Increases Traffic and Storage Limits on New Plans After Overwhelmingly Negative Feedback on Initial Rollout\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132594\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:142:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-increases-traffic-and-storage-limits-on-new-plans-after-overwhelmingly-negative-feedback-on-initial-rollout\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8155:\"<p>WordPress.com officially <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/04/05/introducing-wordpress-pro-one-plan-infinite-possibilities/\">announced</a> its new <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">pricing</a> yesterday, after rolling it out on April 1. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-major-unannounced-pricing-changes-slashes-free-storage-limits\">lack of communication</a> about the changes, and the free plan&#8217;s severely pared back storage and traffic limits, alarmed and frustrated many users who for years have considered WordPress.com their go-to platform for simple blogging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com has simplified its offerings from five plans to two plans: Free and Pro. The service has updated its plans from the initial rollout based on overwhelmingly negative feedback about the changes. The initial plans capped traffic at 10K visits on the free plan and 100K on Pro, and limited free users to 500MB of storage. The updated plans drop the traffic limits entirely and revise the Free plan storage limit to 1GB. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The changes apply to new plans and purchases. Customers on the old plans will not be affected. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a thread on the service&#8217;s support forums, WordPress.com CEO Dave Martin said the old plans were &#8220;overcomplicated and confusing.&#8221; He offered a few reasons for the simplification of the plans and the major pricing changes: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Straightforward Pricing</em>&nbsp;— We want to avoid using dark patterns, or trickery to get people signed up, only to then switch pricing on them down the line (which, unfortunately, many other hosts do these days).</li><li><em>Fewer Plans</em>&nbsp;— Reduce the number of plans we have making it easier for customers to make a plan selection.</li><li><em>Access to Custom Plugins &amp; Themes</em>&nbsp;— Make custom plugins and themes available on all paid plans. Previously, this was only made available on our old $25/mo Business plan.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Monthly billing has also disappeared from the new plans, but Martin said the company is monitoring feedback regarding this change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the previous pricing page, it&#8217;s clear the new plans are much easier to understand at a glance. However, the major point of contention seems to be how big the jump is between the Free plan and Pro plan, especially for those who simply want to blog with a custom domain. Depending on what region you live in, the previous Personal plan was $4/month and Premium was $8/month for customers who needed a little more to enhance their blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />WordPress.com&#8217;s plans prior to April 1, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Small personal blogs and free users seem to be the most affected by the pricing update. It&#8217;s not clear the magnitude of the impact these changes will have, because WordPress.com still has not revealed the planned options for purchasing additional storage and add-ons. Curiously, these upgrade options were not available in the initial rollout,  nor were they included in the official announcement this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Upgrading from $0 to $15 with nothing in between is a big jump and frankly I see more benefit from shifting platforms than from shifting from the greatly reduced $0 plan to this new plan,&#8221; WordPress.com user @davekay <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/pricing-feedback/#post-3809293\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another user @griffinsgadgets <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/pricing-feedback/page/4/#post-3810134\">said</a> &#8220;the zero or everything approach just doesn&#8217;t work for bloggers and owners of small sites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m happy to pay around $8.50 a month, which is what Wix charges for the ability to have a custom domain, no ads and 3GB of storage. I’m now in the process of figuring out how to migrate the site I’ve spent two months building to the Wix platform. I can envisage an exodus of small site owners as a result of this sudden and unannounced pricing change.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com may be moving towards better sustainability by focusing on business customers and site builders, but bloggers feel left behind with these pricing changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;$4 for a hobby blog on which I was making no money, up to $15 for a hobby blog on which I will continue to be making no money, is a huge price hike that I just can’t justify,&#8221; WordPress.com user @renkotsuban said. &#8220;I understand that hobbyists like me no longer make up the core of WordPress users (remember when it was a fork of b2? lol) but wow, not even a heads up before just rolling it out?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pricing changes were also rolled out before regional pricing could be applied. For a global company, this will affect users in different, unexpected ways. After their first impressions of the news, the platform may not get a second chance from those who experienced sticker shock during the rocky launch phase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It feels like you’ve trapped us in the net with good prices and flexible options, and now you’re taking advantage of our loyalty,&#8221; @alinaeo <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/pricing-feedback/page/2/#post-3809745\">said</a>. &#8220;Not everybody needs a pro plan. Also, 150-180$ a year is huge for Romanian users. $15 in Romania means one-week groceries for one person.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress.com&#8217;s Communication Policy Leaves Users Feeling Frustrated and Disappointed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In explanation of the lack of communication with the initial rollout, WordPress.com CEO Dave Martin said, &#8220;We often make an announcement several days after a change is made so we have room to work out issues that may arise.&#8221; This is a policy the platform&#8217;s leadership should consider revising, as it&#8217;s clear from copious feedback that WordPress.com users do not like or appreciate that approach. Even if current customers were not affected by the changes, they had to look to the support forums to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because of this and the unsettled (ongoing) and unsettling plan/price changes with their poor optics, I’ve already transferred my custom domain away from WordPress to Hover, and I’ve been seriously considering alternative content management systems,&#8221; WordPress.com user @jasonmcfadden <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/pricing-feedback/page/3/#post-3809909\">said</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The staff at WordPress.com have been monitoring a long <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/pricing-feedback/\">support forum thread</a> for feedback, which has been overwhelmingly negative. The team is considering their feedback and incorporating it into pricing changes but also losing customers at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I believe that it’s in poor practice to make a change without announcing it at all and to then tackle issues that arose afterwards,&#8221; WordPress.com user @magiwastaken <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/pricing-feedback/#post-3809423\">said</a>. &#8220;It feels a bit like an attempt at deception and I’d expect better communication on big changes like this one from WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This practice of rolling out major pricing changes to test the waters and then making changes based on feedback is somewhat unorthodox. WordPress.com users who took time to offer their feedback were fairly unified in their expectation of transparency around pricing changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Stealth changes to pricing and plans is not something I can get behind,&#8221; WordPress.com user @aywren <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/pricing-feedback/page/2/#post-3809434\">said</a>. &#8220;Something like this should have been announced way in advance – even Netflix tells me months ahead when a price hike is coming. I understand you want to test things before announcing them, but that’s why you write something up that says things are subject to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Please, please, don’t make customers have to search the support forum to try to piece together something as important as pricing changes<strong>.</strong>&#8220;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 21:53:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Post Status: This Week at WordPress.org (April 4, 2022)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://poststatus.com/this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-4-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8442:\"<p>Each week we are highlighting the news from WordPress.org that you don\'t want to miss.

Chris has been a user and educator in the WordPress and web development space for many years. He&#8217;s an author, podcaster, developer, but it&#8217;s perhaps best known for his website.

CSS-Tricks has been a valuable source of information about CSS for over 15 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updated multiple times a week, the site has articles about every aspect of styling your website. It&#8217;s gone through several iterations over those years, not just in the way it looks, but in the manner in which it&#8217;s managed and maintained.

We go right back to the start, and talk about what his motivations were for starting, and then continuing to run the site. Were there any low points where he lost his motivation to keep it going? How has the site changed over the years? And why did he finally decide to sell the site and how he landed upon Digital Ocean as the new custodian?

Hello Chris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:05] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Hello Nathan, pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you for joining us on the Tavern Jukebox podcast today. We&#8217;re here to talk about a project which has been going on, it really feels like as long as I&#8217;ve been into the internet, and that is CSS-Tricks. I am pretty certain that if you are in any way connected with web design, development, WordPress, whatever, you will have come across CSS-Tricks, and the podcast has come about because of a choice that you made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was going to say last week, but I bet it goes back way further than that, to sell CSS-Tricks. And Chris, can we get into that a little bit later? First of all, can I just ask you some generic questions? I hate to be boring, but it would be good for anybody that hasn&#8217;t heard of you, small though that audience would be, tell us about you. What&#8217;s your background with WordPress and technology? Just give us your backstory basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Oh, sure. To kind of focus it I suppose on CSS-Tricks a bit. It was started in 2007, so it is kind of old, I think there is something of a generation of front-end specific developers that where, I was coming up in this industry at the same time that they were. And you know, I&#8217;ve been a very consistent blogger, I guess, throughout that time, you know, I would probably write a blog post today for those 15 years practically. Most of them landing on CSS-Tricks.com. It&#8217;s a WordPress website. It&#8217;s always been a WordPress website. I&#8217;ve tried to run it as a pretty like stock WordPress site. Just go with the flow of what WordPress does. I only mentioned that because this is a WordPress specific website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel like WordPress people might like to know some specifics about the WordPress nature of it. Even as far as, Gutenberg and the block editor and all that, trying to get on board as soon as possible and embrace that a bit. So it&#8217;s kind of a middle-aged website in a way that when I started it, I didn&#8217;t feel like I am riding the wave, the early wave of blogging or anything like that. Not at all. I feel like I was, at the time, I might&#8217;ve felt late to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you begin because you had a burning desire to blog or was it a burning desire to blog about CSS? What was the purpose?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:14] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> I think it was both of those things. Well, just because there was some desire that writing and publishing, somewhere deep in me was a good idea, or that I got a kick out of it in some way. The idea that the words that I write can be published so quickly and so easily, and that anybody in the world can read it and react to it. And I can just be part of this global community. I think that&#8217;s cool. I still think that&#8217;s very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How did you land on CSS as the thing? Were you in employment at the time where that was a concept that you were learning or really getting into? Was it a hobby?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:48] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> I mean the short answer is that I was into the web, but I wasn&#8217;t getting exposure to it at school, as much as I wanted to. We didn&#8217;t really learn HTML and CSS web stuff at school. And I was like, why not? This is weird. You know, this is clearly happening, but it was just too early for a state university to have latched on early enough to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was kind of learning on the side and getting kicked out of wow, I can, I can actually make websites. And I graduate college and that hobby persists, what I really want is this point, I&#8217;m like, I wish this was my job. Because clearly it&#8217;s some people&#8217;s jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why can&#8217;t it be my job? And I&#8217;m looking for jobs, I can&#8217;t get one. I try and try and just couldn&#8217;t be hired as a web. I think I was probably focused on being a web designer mostly because my degree from university ended up being in art and graphic design, and focusing on ceramics really, and I knew I couldn&#8217;t hack it as a ceramic artist, but I was interested in the aesthetics, mostly, and the communication aspects of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m trying to get a job as a web designer and I&#8217;m like, I know I&#8217;m not very good, but I still want to work in it. But I relegated myself to like, I&#8217;m not good enough yet. So, let me just work on getting better at it while I do something else. And that&#8217;s something else was working in the printing industry. I worked for years and years in digital prepress it was called, which is essentially taking documents from designers and getting them ready to run on physical printing presses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked in the printing industry for a long time. That&#8217;s the industry that my mom is in. And she kind of helped me find jobs in that arena. Which was nice, it was fine. At least it was working on computers, and my whole life just learning computer stuff was always of interest to me. It&#8217;s not like I was masterful at it, but I feel like I took to the job of digital prepress, which was manipulating these documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being clever with design stuff and solving the issues that designers had and getting their documents to press. You&#8217;d be surprised at the kind of the garbage shape that design documents come in. They&#8217;re almost never really quite ready to be printed. They&#8217;re full of mistakes and bad assumptions and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, even while I&#8217;m doing that, and I end up working some really weird shifts, like some graveyard shift, 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM stuff because these printing shops run 24 hours a day to get the jobs done and they need somebody in prepress on staff all night long. And it was the less busy of the shifts to, you know, there&#8217;s nobody in the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if there was nothing to do, I&#8217;d be poking around at building websites. And then I go home and work on websites. It was such a fun hobby to me that I&#8217;d enjoyed the spirit of making anything online. So fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there was no intention at the beginning for this to be anything more than a hobby, a labor of love. It was just tinkering and playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:33] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Well, there was a bit, there was actually because, I&#8217;ll always remember this blog that was about earning income or at least side income from blogging specifically. It was Darren Rose&#8217;s pro blogger.com or.net or something. And he had a couple of blogs that he made money on the side. And then he would blog about that blog. It was very meta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think he had some like camera review website or something. He was a photographer and he would write about reviews of cameras and equipment and stuff and put affiliate links on it. And it was probably before the days of sponsored content so much, but it was the days of where display ads were good money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He clearly made good money off just blogging. Off just the idea of, I can create content and I can monetize it. And I did have that in me somewhere. I was like, maybe this isn&#8217;t my job, but I would love to make some side income. Who wouldn&#8217;t, you know? Side income&#8217;s awesome. Even if it&#8217;s beer money fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would start various blogs with the idea of, all I gotta do is, stick with this, make content, put ads on it, get beer money, be happy, you know, as a little idea. And I had loads of different ideas of this. One of them was, you know, making websites about Adobe products, in the spirit of providing help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had this friend who has working phone support for Adobe, but third party. Adobe hires some third-party company to do their phone support, or they did at the time. And he would know, he had his finger on the pulse of what people call in about, and be like, let&#8217;s turn that into a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like dang near every phone call. Might as well leverage that in an SEO kind of fashion and be like, what does this error code mean? Or how do I turn my PDF into a EPS or who knows what. So we&#8217;d blog those and then, hopefully get some SEO value on it, and put Google Adsense on it and get some beer money. And that we did, it just that it wasn&#8217;t very passionate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t care that much about solving people&#8217;s PDF problems, in retrospect, you know. At the time I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t even know how much you need to care. If it made money, hand over fist, maybe I could have gained the passion for it. I don&#8217;t know. But one of the blogs I started was a, at this point, I&#8217;d built probably dozens of websites, all garbage, but Hey, I built them. And I built it with WordPress notably because I don&#8217;t know how I picked it, I just did. It seemed like the right choice at the time for spinning up a website fairly quickly. And as far as I know, WordPress was always kind of a CSS, even the very early days of WordPress, all the themes were CSS. You know, even though it was very early web, I think that embraced that early spirit of CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it was a case of throwing spaghetti against the wall of various different topics. And CSS was the one that landed and stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:16] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Yeah, it was the least successful of them, but it was the most fun one to write. And then that success changed as I, as the other ones dropped off. I focused on this one. Mostly because it was just fun. And I think fun has a way of sticking, it&#8217;s the stickiest spaghetti as it were. And then little early success started to happen, you know. Like I get an email from, at the time, one of the big businesses, at least in this little niche industry I was in was PSD to HTML. And that was just a generic term, meaning all y&#8217;all know Photoshop, but very few people know HTML and CSS. So just send them your Photoshop file and they&#8217;ll send you back a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it ended up being this kind of commoditized industry where there&#8217;s not just one, but lots of companies doing this, and charging really, like a hundred bucks, they would do that for. And I was always like, weirdly, not fundamentally opposed to it, but I was like the kind of people I&#8217;m talking to on this website, aren&#8217;t the kind of people that would use that service because they&#8217;re trying to do it themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, I think there was probably people that were trying to do it themselves, but then would give up and be like, oh, this is too complicated. I&#8217;ll just pay somebody a hundred bucks and get it. So I think those companies must have saw that in my audience and wanted to pay me money to put display ads on the website for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of them was quite literally called PSD to HTML. And it was so unofficial, I was just like, oh, I dunno, PayPal me a hundred bucks or something. And I put the little ad on there, and then I would notch up the price over time. Once in a while they would want to go bigger, you know, can you make the ad bigger? Sure. How about 250 bucks then, you know? And then I hand managed that for a long time. We had Treehouse became a sponsor for many years, and that was also very much just a handshake agreement and PayPal transfers. And I would hand craft the ads that I would put on the site, but the, eventually that fell away to more like traditional self service. Send us the asset. And I became a partner with this company called buy sell ads, who was our advertising partner all the way until I sold the website. They&#8217;re a great company that handles the sales and placement of ads on websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Over time, it&#8217;s become something which was a hobby, which you didn&#8217;t anticipate becoming successful it because of the content became successful. And you stumbled into ways of monetizing it and justifying it in terms of the hours that you were spending on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:48] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Exactly. that&#8217;s a good way to say it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do like that it wasn&#8217;t intentional. It was just, it just occurred over time and it may have done, and it may not have done. Rewind history 15 years and maybe that spaghetti didn&#8217;t stick and something else would&#8217;ve done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I don&#8217;t know that it was entirely chance and I mean, it was a, that was a big part of it, but it was evolved to rank content that worked. And learned from that. And I evolved business model wise to double down on the things that were working and get rid of the things that weren&#8217;t working. It definitely was like labor and trying to understand the business and changing the business to make sure that it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did it become more intentional over time? So as you began 15 years ago and it was what it was. And then five years later it was something slightly different. There was a financial benefit to keeping it going. And five years later after that, it was even more so. Did you modify it to become a business? Did you take on staff and guest writers so that your audience was satisfied?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Yeah. there was some kind of moments where those things happened. For one thing, the first employee I ever hired, I think was Sarah Cope. The idea was we wanted to sell t-shirts and swag and stuff. So maybe I would just print a bunch of stuff. And then when somebody ordered it, we&#8217;d ship it out. We&#8217;d have a kind of a permanent swag business. But there wasn&#8217;t really companies around at the time that would just manage that all for you. Like there probably is now. So Sarah just did it. I had all this stuff printed, it went to her house. She lived in Ohio. She had a whole room of her house that got kind of taken over by swag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she would just, every day or every other day or whatever, run to the post office and mail out the orders that came in and all that. So that kind of cracked the nut on having an employee. And then she would help with more site stuff over time and then got too busy for it or swags started to diminish and sales and stuff, you know, things change over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I forget what was the end of it, but eventually she stopped working for CSS-Tricks and then other people would come on. You know, I had Jeff Graham was with me for so many years all the way up until the end at CSS-Tricks. And now he&#8217;s even going to go over to Digital Ocean and help continue working on the site there. He came on as like an editor and a writer, but then, you know, fell into more editing and more like site management and dealing with sponsors and just dealing with authors and just doing a ton of stuff on the site. That was kind of a moment when Jeff helped take over on some of that stuff. Partially naturally, just cause I, I felt too busy and I needed the help. These things are little moments in time where the site shifted and changed. Like, there was a whole, a whole period of time where I was trying to get staff writers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to have a staff, like a magazine would. Of writers and that kind of worked for a little while, and then kind of stopped working for whatever reason. I can&#8217;t really remember. And we kind of fell back into a, just a one-off writer spirit, which was, the model that we ended with. I&#8217;m sure if I kept running the site for years to come, that that model would shift again over time. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That model was pretty nice. Write in with your pitch, we work with you on your pitch. We publish the article, we pay for it. That&#8217;s what CSS-Tricks is today. And I think is the plan of how Digital Ocean is going to run it as well, because vibes pretty well with their content model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ll come to that in a minute. I&#8217;m just going to stay on the personal side of things, if that&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ll split the next few minutes up into upsides and downsides. So you&#8217;ve got this project, CSS-Tricks, it&#8217;s taken off, you got money coming in and there&#8217;s bound to be upsides and bound to be downsides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s just explore those. Let&#8217;s get the downsides out of the way shall we? What are some of the things that looking back over the last 15 years, you recall as moments of headaches, heartaches, things that you wish you&#8217;d done differently or things that you wish, perhaps you&#8217;d never done at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> That&#8217;s tricky. There&#8217;s really not that many. I didn&#8217;t take as many risks running this site as other people and specifically entrepreneurs have. I&#8217;m really betting the farm on this and, if something goes wrong, I could be risking my house and home on it. I pretty much always have had other jobs as I did this. So my worry level was always lowish on what happens at CSS-Tricks. I always had in the back of my mind, like, man, if this thing gets burned to the ground, oh, well, there&#8217;s always something else I can do. But there&#8217;d be a little moments, at one time we published a sponsored post from some company that we really shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was like a company that sold SSL certificates, but that was actually kind of slimy about doing it. And that kind of like embarrassing moment where you get called out on it and you&#8217;re like, ooh. Or we publish something that, an article that didn&#8217;t take accessibility in mind nearly as well as it should have. Not just ignored it, but straight up bad accessibility practices in it and getting called out for that and having that be embarrassing, not great. Having people disagree with other advertisers or something. Those are moments that don&#8217;t feel good, but really aren&#8217;t that bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No. Did you ever find it to be? I don&#8217;t know, maybe the words treadmill are suitable here. Was it ever, ever moments where you thought, oh, really? I&#8217;ve got to write an article for CSS-Tricks because I haven&#8217;t done one for a week or so. Did you ever feel it to be a grind or a noose around your neck?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:04] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Sometimes the sponsorship related stuff felt like that. Honestly, it kind of did at the end. There was moments where you&#8217;d wake up and be like, oh my gosh, I totally forgot about this. It&#8217;s got to go out today. I got to wrangle the content for it. I got to basically look up with this company does because it made it this far, so it, it&#8217;s probably not abhorrent. It was agreed upon earlier, but I haven&#8217;t really researched what they do entirely yet. And it has to be my words. So it&#8217;s going to be a really quick turnaround and like, there&#8217;s some stress to that, that I didn&#8217;t really like. You know, what&#8217;s never stressful for me was writing about web stuff. If it&#8217;s just write a blog post about some link that I&#8217;ve saved, that I really, I saved on purpose cause I&#8217;m into it, and want to share it. I always liked that. I still like that. That&#8217;s not stressful to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s stressful is the stuff that you&#8217;re like. The only reason I run ads is to keep the site going because there&#8217;s people that need to be paid. This is a business that I&#8217;ve chosen to run. The agreement has already been made. Part of that agreement is that this content is going to run at this date at this time. And I do other things as well. You know, I have a podcast of my own and I have a much, much bigger project in Codepen that I&#8217;m a boss of, I&#8217;m a co-founder of, and I have responsibility for that needs the attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I&#8217;m off writing a blog post, that&#8217;s attention of mine that&#8217;s not being spent on Codepen and that&#8217;s something I wanted to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe a feeling of being spread too thin, but nothing too bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:33] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Nothing too bad, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s exactly right. I still, you know, I&#8217;m still waiting for that relief in a way. As you and I are talking, we&#8217;re less than a month off of the sale there&#8217;s still like, so much work to do that I haven&#8217;t felt any particular, the treadmill hasn&#8217;t stopped yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe we should have organized this podcast six months from now, and maybe you&#8217;d have felt the full weight of the relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:55] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> I&#8217;m enjoying the fact though that I get to be out on podcasts like this and talk about it though. So I appreciate that because, it&#8217;s nice to know that it&#8217;s at least a little bit of news In this industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In my book, it&#8217;s a big piece of news. Let&#8217;s do the positives. Let&#8217;s do the upsides. So you&#8217;ve got a very successful website. You&#8217;ve affected a lot of people. You&#8217;ve helped a lot of people. You&#8217;ve probably met a lot of people. But there may be some unexpected consequences as well. So again, the same sort of question, but in reverse, if you look back over the last 15 years, what are the things that you&#8217;re really pleased about, that came about because of CSS-Tricks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:32] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Well, there&#8217;s so many. I was always pleased publishing an article and hearing people&#8217;s reactions to it. I think that&#8217;s part of the motivation and why it never became so painful or it never felt like a treadmill to write actual content, because it&#8217;s so satisfying. Even the early days, all the way through it, to write something and have people say like, oh yeah, I see what you mean there, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or have it actually influenced the article, or the industry in some way, you know, that you write some code that people use on their website and then they tell you about it or that they got some job because of something that they learned from CSS-Tricks or something. So satisfying, so satisfying, you know. And to kind of help people&#8217;s career in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes they write for CSS-Tricks and that&#8217;s a seminal moment in their life and good things open for them. That was true for me too, though in that that CSS-Tricks was the thing that opened the door for me in other ways, like my first job. I had one job as a web designer that I kind of fell back wards into that was, it was great. It was, it was good to be hired finally to do web design work. And I was very happy to have that job, but it didn&#8217;t quite feel like a tech job. It wasn&#8217;t a startup. I was kind of the only web guy there not a newbie somewhere where everybody else knew more about building websites than I did, which is kind of what I wanted. And if I didn&#8217;t have CSS-Tricks, I&#8217;m not sure I would have been able to break into the industry in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So CSS-Tricks exists. I used it in the early days, such a fan of this website, Wufoo. Which is a form builder thing. Yeah. Really great days for me. I was able to gush about it to some degree on CSS-Tricks, which doesn&#8217;t go unnoticed, if anybody was gushing about Codepen, I would, I would know about it, but blog posts have that kind of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I end up getting a job at Wufoo, which was my real break into the industry of tech. It was great for me cause I made more money and it gave CSS-Tricks more clout and it helped Wufoo too I&#8217;m sure, and really was just a virtuous cycle that started by virtue of that. And then I got to experience what acquisitions were like because Wufoo got purchased by Survey Monkey, which is a huge deal in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I had no ownership of Wufoo, I still got to like, take the ride with everybody else who did. And we all moved out to California because that&#8217;s where Survey Monkey was based. And that was just such a big transformative moment and lots of change, but really all positive in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing how much you can anchor back to CSS-Tricks. Just the fact that you&#8217;ve moved across country and perhaps the seed of that was a blog that you started many years before. That&#8217;s pretty remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:08] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Speaking was a part of it too. It hasn&#8217;t been a huge part of my career monetarily, cause I think that it would be difficult to make your job, speaking at conferences. I don&#8217;t know if the pay is quite there in this industry. But, it can be part of a whole, that if you speak at conferences, then more people read your blog and you&#8217;re able to write a book and sell the book and all those things kind of feed into each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And CSS-Tricks definitely opened the door for me speaking at conferences, which I used to do a lot of. So that was a very positive thing. You know, that&#8217;s what I, and that&#8217;s what I got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s opened many doors by the sounds of it. Yeah. remarkable. So, more recently the news broke that you&#8217;d decided to sell it. Let&#8217;s just take that into two parts. The first part is why did you sell it? If you&#8217;re prepared to discuss that? And the second part is how. How do you even sell a blog? Maybe there&#8217;s a company which organized that kind of thing for you, or maybe you just stumbled into somebody and it just got done on the back of a placemat or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know. So let&#8217;s go first with why and then we&#8217;ll do the, how. Why did you decide to sell it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> It&#8217;s all kind of mixed together because I didn&#8217;t set out to do it. I didn&#8217;t even shop it around really. I mean, maybe I should have or something, but I, it&#8217;s not really my style I guess. They came knocking, and I understood why. I was like, okay. Right away, it made sense to me why they would want it. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a lot of suitors out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was making a list of companies that would have any desire to own CSS-Tricks. I don&#8217;t think the list is that long. I don&#8217;t mean to sell myself short, maybe it is. It doesn&#8217;t seem like blogs are a hotly traded commodity these days, you know. You don&#8217;t see a lot of blog acquisitions in a way. Especially one that&#8217;s so personal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of people attach CSS-Tricks to me, even though there&#8217;s so many guest writers that I&#8217;m kind of the face behind the site for better or worse. So why would you want to buy this thing that already has this face, you know? But in the case of Digital Ocean, they have long since doubled down on content marketing anyway. They would advertise on CSS-Tricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they knew the potential of, surely they had analytics numbers of how successful that can be and probably were running internal numbers. That&#8217;s like, wow, what if we could do a lot more of that only, you know, we own the site so that the competition of who&#8217;s being shown advertising wise on the site falls away and it&#8217;s only us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content wise, I knew this, but I didn&#8217;t know to the degree of which this was true until this was further along, is that they have tons of content on their site that&#8217;s much more backend focused. I&#8217;m less backend focused as a person. So I just wasn&#8217;t as aware of it, I guess, but people that do lots of backend work, find their way to information on Digital Ocean&#8217;s site a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has just loads of good information that&#8217;s well regarded in the industry. To compliment that with buying more content that, hopefully is well-regarded content on the front end side, maybe fills a gap for them, especially knowing how important front end development is getting in the world of web development period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there is a shift towards there just being a lot more front end developers because that skillset of knowing Javascript, and how much like easier hosting and stuff is getting and what a shift to JAMstack and stuff. I know that&#8217;s, a weird subject in WordPress land, but there&#8217;s a lot of that going on industry-wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure everyone can see that and being like, well, we should be catering, advertising, talking to front end developers as much as we are backend developers, because they&#8217;re starting to be the decision makers to, on even things like hosting. Which is what Digital Ocean is there like a cloud provider of services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they should be on front end developers radars as much as backend developers. And so I got it. You know, I was like, I understand why you would want this. And they&#8217;ve had some, they&#8217;re public now. So they have some money to spend and some money they, you know, so, so I was like, oh, I get that too. You know, maybe this really is a match made in heaven. And so knowing that, they could run the site, they could do it with more people than we have. You know, like I said, I&#8217;m trying to spend all my time on Codepen. So like, I haven&#8217;t sat down to say, okay, we got Jeff, we got Robin at the site. Maybe I should, like what&#8217;s a business plan for 2022, 2023 here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we hire five more people and make a play at X, Y, and Z? Should we, what should we do? You know what? I would do, nothing. I would just be like, nah, let&#8217;s just keep doing what we&#8217;re doing. I don&#8217;t have the time to, to think about this. I don&#8217;t have time to staff up and, yada yada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when they&#8217;re like, we can put our whole community team behind this. I&#8217;m giving it to a site that I know why they want it. I have provable evidence that they do a good job with content. We can run the site with less advertising in general on it, which has always appeals to me as somebody who&#8217;s redesigned the site 19 times, the idea of redesigning the site without as much having to, to incorporate advertising into every corner of it possible seemed appealing to me. Like we could run the site a little cleaner that way and have all these people behind it and breathe new life into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course there&#8217;s the money which I cannot talk about and don&#8217;t want to talk about, but, obviously that&#8217;s a part of decision-making duh, right. And having that be like, yeah, okay. That seems fair to me. Right on. I&#8217;ll get some of my time back, the site goes to a good place, that&#8217;s going to take care of it. It&#8217;s not even being redirected or anything. It just stays right where it is. So if you were an author who&#8217;s written for CSS-Tricks, it&#8217;s irrelevant to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your, your byline stays right there. URL stays right there. If anything, your website is just being taken care of, or your article is just being taken care of by more people with even higher incentive than I had to take care of it and presented in a cleaner way, that&#8217;s just seems like a big old win-win. When I got to thinking about it and talking with my family about it, I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s time for this change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. In the WordPress space, there&#8217;s been lots of acquisitions recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:02] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Oh, yeah, what&#8217;s up with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The thing, which always is released in the press release, which comes out the same day as everything is finally tied up and make public always makes the point that nothing is going to change. You know, it&#8217;s going to stay exactly the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you have any sort of red lines, any things that you said, please may we keep this bit as it is right now? Or are you just handing it over and saying, okay, it&#8217;s yours. You do what you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:27] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> They told me early on that they were going to not, they were going to leave the site where it is. So that was part of my decision making. Now I can&#8217;t enforce that. There&#8217;s nothing in the, in any legal agreement that says that they can never change anything. I mean, it&#8217;s their site now they can do whatever they want for it, but it&#8217;s held true already, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re just running it as it is there. And I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a smart decision for now, I think because it&#8217;s complicated enough site, you might as well get to know it pretty intimately before you start making changes anyway. But I&#8217;ve seen it held true before though. I mean, when I went through that Wufoo Survey Monkey transition, you can go to Wufoo.com right now and they left it alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, they just made it a little better over time. It hasn&#8217;t seen like intensive new development or anything, but it&#8217;s still a pretty darn nice website to make a web form on. So I lived through experiences where that stuff is no lie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. The only change that&#8217;s visible to me is they&#8217;ve put a fairly minimal logo next to the logo. If you know what I mean. It says powered by Digital Ocean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:24] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> I mean, I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, you did that. Okay. Yeah. But aside from that, it does seem to be exactly the same great content in exactly the same display. Just a complete aside from me, I have to commend your design. 19 ways that you&#8217;ve designed the site over many years. Every one of them breathtakingly good, so bravo for all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:44] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you&#8217;re welcome. It&#8217;s all tied up. The deal is done. You&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times that you are going to concentrate on the project, which I think it&#8217;s fair to say is the one which provides for your family more than any other, Codepen. Have I got that right? Or are you, are you looking to branch out and use up that time that was on CSS-Tricks with something new or are you totally doubling down on Codepen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:08] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> You know, if I had time that I really wanted to spend doing a side project thing, I would, I&#8217;d rather just stare at the ceiling at this point. I could use some, I use a little break. But now that time&#8217;s going to go to Codepen. Codepen, needs, we are in the middle of big, I mean, I guess changes is the right way to do it, but we have some big ideas for what Codepen could be, and we&#8217;ve had these ideas for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just stop you there actually. And can you just tell us what Codepen is? I know what it is, but maybe there&#8217;s a collection of people that will really benefit from using it. So yeah, just, yeah. Tell us what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:41] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Yeah. You know, and it started off as a thing for CSS-Tricks anyway. I mean, the stories are interwoven in a way. So Codepen is like a code editor in the browser. So pen is like the term we have for a thing that you create on Codepen, and it&#8217;s a social network in that you sign up for it, you have an account, do you have a profile on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s free to do so. Uh, and then there&#8217;s pro features. So it&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s a SaaS product, but freemium, you know, like you can sign up for pro and you get extra stuff. But the point of it is, you know, I follow you, you follow me, you&#8217;re making work, I&#8217;m making work and we can like each other&#8217;s work and talk about it and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those work are those pens and pens are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It&#8217;s entirely focused on the front end side of the web. And people use it to like build little demos. They&#8217;re like, look at this, look at this thing that I&#8217;ve made. And sometimes it&#8217;s art. Sometimes it&#8217;s a reduced test case for a problem they&#8217;re having. Sometimes it&#8217;s a little example of something they&#8217;re going to send to a client. Sometimes it&#8217;s just an exploration of a cool idea they want to get out of their head. Sometimes they&#8217;re learning some new technology that they&#8217;ve never played with before. So why not do it on Codepen, because it&#8217;s so quick and easy to get started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes people learning do it because it has this built in ability, basically when you stop typing into one of the editors, the code editors on Codepen, there&#8217;s a preview right next to it that instantly updates. So there&#8217;s that mental connection between the code that you&#8217;re writing in the output for it? Which of course you can wire up locally as well, but on Codepen, it&#8217;s just a website. So you click a button and you&#8217;re in that environment immediately. You don&#8217;t have to install anything. You can come back to it later and it&#8217;s still waiting there for you. You don&#8217;t have to save it to your file system and worry about losing it. You can search for it. I know I&#8217;ve just spit out a lot of words there, but the core of it is it&#8217;s easy to use code editor, right in the browser that has social features attached to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;re going to be doubling down on work there. And presumably you&#8217;ve got a little bit of extra time to do that. What&#8217;s on the roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:44] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I can&#8217;t tell you everything in the whole roadmap, but some of it is fairly obvious in the stuff we&#8217;ve talked about already is that we want you to be able to do more on Codepen, but without losing the simplicity, that&#8217;s already there. There&#8217;s just the world of web development is ever-changing, which is just like a very obvious thing to say, but there&#8217;s always new libraries and new processors and new ways to approach building websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we kind of want to embrace that change and build and change and morph our online editor experience to be just more ready forever change. You know, ready for whatever comes along the industry and gets ready for it and just make a much better online editor experience to the point where you&#8217;re like, this is so good, I want to use it. That you use Codepen because the editor experience is just so good, and integrates with everything that you need it to be integrated with and can build whatever you want to build with it, but still keeps that like simplicity keeps that catching people earlier in their careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the one thing Codepen does well is we catch people early in their coding careers as they&#8217;re just starting to learn. I want to keep them, as they level up and learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s linked from almost everywhere, isn&#8217;t it? If you&#8217;re learning something off a third-party website, you more or less guarantee that there&#8217;s a Codepen link on that somewhere, sort of demonstrating, okay, this bit of code will output this, okay, go and check on Codepen. It&#8217;s just used absolutely everywhere. It&#8217;s a sublimely good product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:11] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> For me as I&#8217;m running Codepen, all I see is the things that it can&#8217;t do, you know, or the things that I wish that I could do. And so I want to, want to fix those, fix those gaps and get even more people. And then the business model, there&#8217;s some advertising on it like CSS-Tricks because there&#8217;s a lot of eyeballs on Codepen and it&#8217;s money worth making if you can. But I&#8217;d prefer to run it without that, if I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s not good news to our, you know, our advertising partners or whatever, but sorry about that. I&#8217;d rather Just have the product be so good that that&#8217;s the way. It&#8217;s already 75% there. But the idea being that if you&#8217;re pro you know, you get all these extra things, you get the ability to make things private and you get the ability to collaborate with people in real time, and you get the ability to upload assets that will be your host for your assets if we want. And there&#8217;s all these things that you get for being pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to make those even bigger and better and bolder and have there be much more reasons for you to go and stay pro on Codepen. I think there&#8217;s just a lot of opportunity there. And, but this is a big thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like CSS-Tricks I feel like I could run alone if I had to. You know what I mean, cause it&#8217;s just a blog, right? I know WordPress pretty well. I can write. That&#8217;s fine. Codepen I cannot. Codepen and I, there&#8217;s no way I can run alone. This is a very collaborative effort that takes lots of different skill sets to pull off. And it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s the biggest thing I&#8217;ve ever done. And if we pull off everything that we&#8217;re trying to pull off, it will be the biggest thing I ever do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just to wrangle it back to WordPress quickly toward the end. You&#8217;ve been with WordPress for a long time. You said every iteration of the website has been on WordPress. There&#8217;s been a lot of WordPress content. Obviously everything to do with CSS is helping every WordPress website. And I seem to recall purchasing digging into WordPress, your book Jeff Starr right back in the day, when I think he was still on version one. Are we going to see you hanging around the WordPress space at any point, or is that, is that a book which is closing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:05] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> I&#8217;m very sure you will. I mean that would be like, absolutely no promises here, but wouldn&#8217;t that be neat. If you could build a WordPress site on Codepen? It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re barking up that tree immediately, but like, that&#8217;s the kind of thing I have my eye on, you know, like, wouldn&#8217;t that be cool if CodePen was so advanced, you could build a WordPress site on it? Anyway, don&#8217;t read too much into that. But if I was going to build a new website tomorrow, and it was content focused in any way. I would just immediately pick WordPress to do it. I have ideas all the time. I was just driving around this morning and thought of some things that I think would be cool to build and do in WordPress. And I&#8217;m like, well, I absolutely don&#8217;t have time for that now, but I&#8217;m going to build that someday gosh, darn it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, it would be very nice to have Chris Coyier in our community for decades to come. Chris, for all of the hard work that you&#8217;ve done over the years, making everybody&#8217;s life easier to learn CSS, we thank you really, really has helped a lot of people, me included in that list. So firstly, thanks for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And secondly, thank you for coming on the podcast today. I really appreciate it. Just before we go. What are in the future, the best places to find you? That&#8217;s probably different to how it was six weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:12] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> Well, not really, cause I you know, I&#8217;m a big proponent of having a, uh, a personal website. So mine is chriscoyier.net, a WordPress site of course. I did redesign it. It was on my list to do post-acquisition cause I was like, well, you know, I need to not have one of the first sentences say that I own and run CSS-Tricks on it. So I could have easily updated that sentence, but it&#8217;s also kind of my style to, just blah, I&#8217;m going to redesign it in an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I like it, by the way, it&#8217;s very, very bold and beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:42] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> That was about an hour&#8217;s worth of work this morning. Cause you know, the bones of a WordPress site, that&#8217;s this simple anyway, there&#8217;s no, it&#8217;s just a very simple header, a very simple footer and then just a couple of custom post types in there for the different types. There&#8217;s very little to this and I&#8217;ve done it so many times that really I&#8217;m not even exaggerating, it really was probably just a couple hours worth of work to knock out a little design like that and kind of update the text for what I want to that to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all that said, it&#8217;s really my home base because rather than give you my Twitter or something, I&#8217;d rather give you my personal website, get the RSS feed. You know, you do want to follow me on Twitter, that&#8217;s all linked up from my personal website. Again, chriscoyier.net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Chris Coyier. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:24] <strong>Chris Coyier:</strong> My pleasure Nathan.

These were already publicly available. However, some had yet to land in the WordPress plugin directory. As a fan of his simple approach to block design, I was quick to start tinkering with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those projects, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-modified-time-block/\">Post Modified Time Block</a>, landed on WordPress.org yesterday. Along with the yet-released <a href=\"https://github.com/richtabor/post-reading-time-block\">Post Reading Time Block</a> (available on GitHub), the two make a pair of post-meta extensions that should come in handy for many users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both blocks are meant to be used in conjunction with a post rather than dropped haphazardly around the site. Typically, users would place them in one or more of their templates via the site editor (which requires a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">block theme</a>). As shown in the following screenshot, I added them to the post header area in Archeo:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding post updated and reading times to the post header.\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress has never had a &#8220;reading time&#8221; template tag, it does have a post-modified time function. However, there is no equivalent block. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39367\">recent ticket for selecting between</a> the published or modified date/time via the Post Date block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until that lands in WordPress, which will almost assuredly not happen in the current 6.0 release cycle, users can rely on Tabor&#8217;s Modified Time block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding it is as straightforward as inserting any other block. I chose to stick it next to the published date in my theme&#8217;s &#8220;Single&#8221; template.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting the Modified Time block.\n\n\n\n<p>The most immediate thing I missed was the new date-formatting options available in the Post Date block in the Gutenberg plugin. With the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-9-adds-block-locking-ui-automatic-pattern-registration-and-full-theme-exports\">version 12.9 update</a>, users can choose between a locale-aware set of default formats or customize it. The experience is much improved from before, and I hope that Tabor adopts the new component when WordPress 6.0 rolls around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Modified Time block will only output anything if the post has been updated and is older than 24 hours. Depending on the site or theme design, conditionally-displayed blocks can be problematic. For example, if placing one in a Row alongside other post-related blocks and separating each with some character, the &#8220;separator&#8221; sometimes stands alone when the block displays nothing, as shown below:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Published by {author} | Published on {date} | </code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This problem was simple to address in classic, PHP-based themes. However, there is no standard for handling it with blocks. It is not an issue specific to Tabor&#8217;s plugin but something to be mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Reading time&#8221; plugins are a dime a dozen. They seem to have existed for as long as I can remember, but most are starting to show their age. They either rely on shortcodes or automatically inject their output onto the page, leaving the user without control. Tabor&#8217;s Reading Time block brings the feature to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will primarily add this to one or more templates via the site editor, as with the first block. I stuck it below the published and modified times for display on single posts:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting the Reading Time block.\n\n\n\n<p>The block worked well. My only complaint is that it has no text-formatting options. By default, it outputs &#8220;X min read.&#8221; I wanted to display &#8220;Estimated reading time: X&#8221; instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block does not break times down into hours for long&#8212;<em>really long</em>&#8212;form works. It would be a welcome addition for the much rarer use case to display those times in an hour + minutes format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple blocks like these may not garner a developer any fame or fortune. They are not the behemoth projects that one can build a business around. However, they are necessary. Our developer community must take the reigns and fill in the gaps that WordPress has yet to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to see more businesses and developers contributing such blocks. It is a way to pay it forward while gaining real-world experience building on top of the block system. And, there are opportunities aplenty. Look around the WordPress source code for functions or template tags with no block equivalent. For example, where is the &#8220;List Authors&#8221; wrapper for <code>wp_list_authors()</code>? There are also many plugins built on the old shortcode system that need a port.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-modified-time-block/\">Post Modified Time Block</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 02:40:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 10.8 Introduces QR Code Post Sharing, Adds Openverse Media Provider\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132545\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-10-8-introduces-qr-code-post-sharing-adds-openverse-media-provider\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3229:\"<p>People have been asking <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2012/03/08/are-qr-codes-dead/?sh=6c63890e1033\">if QR codes are dead</a> for the past decade, but their relevancy has only increased as digital life becomes more vibrant. eMarketer <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/qr-codes-forecast-trends-2022\">forecasts</a> that the number of US smartphone users scanning QR codes will increase from 83.4 million in 2022 to 99.5 million in 2025.

This call for testing focuses on creating an author template via the site editor. Several of the new features used during this round were only added in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-9-adds-block-locking-ui-automatic-pattern-registration-and-full-theme-exports\">Gutenberg 12.9</a> last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call asks volunteers to test and provide feedback on features related to Full Site Editing before they land in WordPress. Anyone can participate, and the deadline is April 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this round of testing, I used the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/archeo\">Archeo block theme</a>. It is a recent favorite, and I have been working with it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-archeo-wordpress-theme-blends-mayan-history-with-magazine-style-block-patterns\">since I first reviewed it</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a screenshot of my final author template design:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>I read through the testing instructions and forged my own path. I still managed to cover everything except block locking. I had already extensively tested it with Gutenberg 12.9&#8217;s launch and wanted to focus on the other features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the user-experience issues noted below, everything went well. No editor crashes. No problems saving. And the front-end matched what I was seeing in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building an Author Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most immediate issue when creating a new author template is that it was devoid of default blocks. Where was the&#8212;at minimum&#8212;header and footer?</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A blank canvas to start from.\n\n\n\n<p>The empty template would make sense if I was building something from scratch. However, this is not a from-scratch project. It was built from a theme with existing <code>archive.html</code> and <code>index.html</code> files, ancestors in the template hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the author template is merely a more specific version of the archive template, it should be a copy of its &#8220;parent&#8221; in the hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will most likely want to make modifications rather than start from scratch. Using an ancestor template as a base means that they are less likely to unnecessarily deviate from the existing layout, especially with more complex designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second set of actions I took was to go back to the Templates panel, open the archive template, copy all content, and paste it into the new author template.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Copying the content of the author template.\n\n\n\n<p>This is &#8212; while a bit irritating &#8212; easy enough to do, at least from a developer perspective. However, it is a massive boulder sitting in the middle of a user&#8217;s path to success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the design, I fell back on the ever-trustworthy Cover block. I snagged an image that worked with the theme&#8217;s style. Then, I placed the Avatar, Archives Title, and Post Author Biography blocks in two columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a custom author archive page header.\n\n\n\n<p>I spent some time pondering the idea of featured images for authors, categories, and tags. <em>How awesome would it be if the Cover block background was contextually displayed based on the current author?</em> Unfortunately, such a feature does not exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was surprised that the Avatar and Post Author Bio blocks worked. I tested these both inside of the Query Loop and outside of it. When an author has published posts, the two blocks appear as they should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the author has not published any posts, the avatar reverts to the site default, and the bio disappears. I have not performed a deep dive into the code, but I am guessing they pick up on WordPress&#8217;s global <code>$post</code> variable, which is why it works in the first scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Missing avatar and author bio for unpublished author.\n\n\n\n<p>This limitation means that the block system is still not up to par with what is currently possible with classic, PHP-based themes. Avatar, Post Author Biography, and similar blocks should rely on the queried author variable as a fallback when viewing an author archive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One part of this FSE testing round was using the new No Results block from Gutenberg 12.9. It is a conditional block that appears when there are no posts to show. WordPress creates &#8220;author views&#8221; for every user on the site, regardless of whether they have written posts. The No Results block will likely be the most useful in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with the block felt odd at first. <em>Where does it go? After the Post Template? Before?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that you can actually stick it in anywhere inside of the Query Loop parent block. I even tested before and after pagination. Basically, it just works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI left something to be desired. It simply reads:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Add a text or blocks that will display when a query returns no results.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside from the glaring grammatical error</em>, displaying the message is necessary, but I expected it to look and feel more like the Group block. After all, it is essentially a container for other blocks, and WordPress already has an existing UI for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also odd to visually edit a feature that is conditionally displayed. There should be an indicator that its contents may or may not be shown on the front end. I am not aware of any precedent for such a block in core WordPress, but we should look at other projects and how they handle this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-visibility/\">Block Visibility</a> plugin by Nick Diego might be a plugin to borrow from. It adds an overlay, border, and icon for contextual blocks:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Overlay design from Block Visibility plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, I decided to copy McCarthy&#8217;s original message from her test and paste it into the No Results block. Then, I took things one step more and put a Query Loop inside of it &#8212; <em>yes, a Query Loop inside of a Query Loop</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked without issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Querying latest posts when no results are found.\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the No Results block is a welcome addition to the theme-blocks toolset. I would like to see the UI fleshed out a bit. Theme authors will likely start using this more when 6.0 lands, and I could see users inadvertently trying to delete it, thinking it is part of the default output. This would make it a candidate for block-level locking.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:46:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Makes Major Unannounced Pricing Changes, Slashes Free Storage Limits\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132482\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-major-unannounced-pricing-changes-slashes-free-storage-limits\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8128:\"<p>Over the weekend, a post regarding WordPress.com&#8217;s as yet unannounced pricing changes went viral on Hacker News. In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://rootprivileges.net/2022/04/03/what-are-you-doing-wordpress-com/\">What are you doing, WordPress.com?</a>&#8221; one user identified as &#8220;VM&#8221; expressed concerns about the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">pricing</a>, which has changed from five plans to two plans, and slashed storage on the free tier from 3GB to 500MB.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At some point late last week, WordPress replaced all of the paid plans with a single ‘Pro’ plan and reduced the storage on the free plan 6x, from 3 GB to 500 MB,&#8221; VM wrote. &#8220;It also imposed a traffic ceiling on both plans where none existed: 10,000 visits a month and 100,000 visits a month (and it hasn’t said anything about overages – so far).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other WordPress.com users took to the forums to express <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/reason-behind-plan-upgrades/\">frustrations with the new pricing</a>. Although WordPress.com representatives have confirmed that the storage and traffic limits should only affect new sites, many long-time users have reported that their storage has been cut back to 500MB. This may be a bug in the rollout but at the time of publication, WordPress.com has not published a public notice the price changes beyond updating the pricing page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the absence of communication about the change, VM speculated that it may be a cascading effect of the block editor changing how well commercial themes can be monetized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps we should have seen this coming: the new full-site editing option has rendered premium themes, and thus the premium and business plans redundant; the Gutenberg upgrade allowed users on free as well as personal plans to do some of the things that were previously only possible with premium or business plans. But to be honest, the hindsight doesn’t explain why WordPress.com – whose free plan, pro-open-source stance and focus on making publishing technology more democratic made it many a modern (non-technical) blogger’s host of choice – would pull the rug out like this.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com CEO Dave Martin <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30896807\">responded</a> to these concerns on Hacker News, apologizing for the lack of communication in the rollout:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You&#8217;re right to call us out. I did a poor job of sharing context around why we are making change, so I can see how they could come as a shock. I&#8217;m sorry! That&#8217;s on me.</p><p>Yes, as of this week we&#8217;ve gone from 5 plans down to just 2. That said, we&#8217;re not done making changes. This was the first of a couple of phases of changes.</p><p>Those 5 older plans that you mentioned were the culmination of like 10 years worth of plans and features sort of haphazardly being added to WordPress.com with no real strategy. With those older plans, it was really hard for customers to see at-a-glance why they should choose one plan over another.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin said WordPress.com generally adjusts its subscription plan pricing to make it affordable in different regions of the world but neglected to do so for the new Pro plan. The company is working on updating that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said the traffic limits will &#8220;only be enforced on the honor system.&#8221; Users who consistently go over the monthly cap will be prodded with notices to pay more, but their sites will not be shut off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Pro plan you see now (at $15/mo) is essentially the the exact same plan as the old Business plan (which used to cost $25/mo),&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;The only difference being the default storage that is available and a cost savings to customers of $10/mo.&#8221; This plan currently has no option for monthly billing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost savings only affects users who were already paying. New users on the free plan will need to work within the confines of the 500MB storage limit or pay $180/year for the upgrade. This is surprising, given how many people use WordPress.com simply to blog with no business interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Again, this may be great for businesses – but it’s a shit move for bloggers,&#8221; VM said in his post. &#8220;Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic, which runs WordPress.com, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22977857/wordpress-tumblr-simplenote-internet-automattic-matt-mullenweg-interview\" target=\"_blank\">recently said in an interview</a>: &#8216;I’ll tell you a stat most people don’t realize. Half of all users who sign up for WordPress.com every day are there to blog.&#8217; I’ll tell you that for all of <em>these</em> people as well as the people who are using WordPress.com to blog (including me), the new plan is a betrayal of our interests.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Hacker News commenter @username223 <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30896980\">noted</a> how easy it will be for users to max out the free tier in a short amount of time:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Cutting the free tier from 3 GB to 500 MB makes it useless for many people: that&#8217;s 500 images at okay resolution, and lots of people like to put photos on their blogs. And 300 &#8220;visits&#8221; (page hits?) per day is almost as bad, as a runaway crawler or minor spike in interest can blow through that in no time.</p><p>I moved away from WP.com when they started putting ads on the free tier. I thought their business model was upselling some people, so monetizing the free version felt scummy. The fact that they&#8217;re crippling the free version now makes me even more glad I moved away.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin said WordPress.com has plans to offer some à la carte features that may help new free users avoid having to pay $180/year just to increase storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will be announcing affordable add-ons for both the free plan and the Pro plan to extend both your traffic and your storage as needed,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;In fact, we plan to also add a handful of affordable add-ons to the free plan to make it easy for customers to pick and choose which additional functionality they want, without needing to upgrade to the Pro plan.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin&#8217;s responses were reassuring to some users, including the author of the original post. Other found the changes to the free plan to be discouraging,  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30895947\">saying</a> &#8220;the internet has become gentrified.&#8221; The comments on the <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30894980&p=1\">Hacker News</a> post are a gold mine of feedback from a demographic that has developed strong expectations about blogging for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The point is here that &#8216;just here to blog&#8217; bloggers like me have been able to pay WP to have a custom domain, some storage, some SEO and some SM tools managed by WP – and nothing else,&#8221; user <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=panicpanicpanic\">panicpanicpanic</a> said. &#8220;But now, to point a custom domain at my WP site, I need to cough up $180/yr. It&#8217;s not just the free plan shrinking further, a fact you&#8217;re commenting on, but that the sole alternative plan lies at the other extreme.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear whether WordPress.com will offer custom domains as an add-on to the free plan or force users to upgrade to the Pro plan.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states. That&#8217;s probably my most embarrassing WordCamp story. You&#8217;re welcome. Bye!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 04 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #64 – Gutenberg 12.9, Example Repo, and Inline Tokens\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=20855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-64-gutenberg-12-9-inline-tokens/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31210:\"<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack and Mary Job talked about Gutenberg 12.9 new features and enhancements, updates to the Gutenberg Example Repo and share a post  on how to implement inline tokens for Rich Text.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 12.9, WordPress 5.9.3 and the Gutenberg Examples repository, the walkthrough WordPress 6.0 and so much more. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. I&#8217;m here with co-host, Mary Job, also a WordPress advocate, support engineer at Paid Membership Pro and organizer of the WP Africa community. Good evening, Mary, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: I&#8217;m doing very good, Birgit. Hi everyone, hope everyone is doing awesome today in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, the WP Africa community, tell me more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah, that was born out of the needs to be able to connect with more WordPressers on our continent, and to also be able to get more people to be interested in contributing to the WordPress open source project, because &#8230; So, there&#8217;s a colleague of mine named from Benin, but it&#8217;s pronounced Benin over here. It&#8217;s the country right next to ours and there was a survey they did one time to see where the contributors to the open source project were from. When it came to our continent, the percentage was quite very, very, very low. So, we thought to ourselves a good way to get started would be to get to know who and who are using WordPress, doing WordPress on our continent. If we&#8217;re able to connect with more people outside our respective countries, then we can get going from there. Maybe in 2024, 2025, we&#8217;ll get to have a WordCamp Africa, I don&#8217;t know, but we want to have one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. So, how can people connect with WP Africa community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: If you go to the website, wpafrica.org, you can see the directory there. You can join the directory. You can also join the Slack channel. There&#8217;s a Slack channel, Slack workspace for their community. You can also join that, the information is also on the website. Everything you need to know about the project is on wpafrica.org, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful, wonderful. You can use your WordPress login information to actually register with the Slack, I found. So, that&#8217;s very good, yeah. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so we have some announcements and there&#8217;s the all-new Pattern Creator, is live now, so on wordpress.org and it was taken online or opened up for public submissions last week and within a few days, 90 patterns, by about 30 plus designers have been submitted since March 25th. So Mary, did you get a chance to browse the pattern directory? What did you see?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, yes. I got a chance to look at it, it is amazing. I mean, literally, if you wanted to build your site as a newbie, or as a business owner, you can simply take the designs from there and then use them on your site and modify them to your own advantage. You don&#8217;t have to start thinking, &#8220;Oh, how do I get creative with building blocks?&#8221; You can simply take the patterns and use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I particularly like that they have like buttons and the fact that you can submit your own pattern to the directory. I mean, that&#8217;s perfect. You could create a block pattern and then submit it right there on the page. I think it also opens up a chance to contribute. People would think that WordPress is maybe too technical for them, this is something good they could play with and they could see maybe it would bring out a creative spirit in them, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah and I tested that block Pattern Creator and it&#8217;s actually a block editor, that is standalone. It&#8217;s quite an interesting experience and then you submit it and then there is no curation for that matter. There are certain things that you can see on the about page, like the dos and don&#8217;ts, and then it&#8217;s going to be online and people can &#8230; there&#8217;s a little hard, so what you say is a like button, they&#8217;re their favorites. So if you have 90 patterns, or now 160 patterns with the ones that were already in there, or 170 actually, I feel a little bit decision paralysis, where you say, &#8220;Oh, I like them all.&#8221; So yeah, when I look for a price list or column blocks or something like that, I don&#8217;t know. So, you can browse them at your leisure. Put some hearts or check the hearts on it and then you have a separate page that says, &#8220;My favorites,&#8221; and that&#8217;s a really good way to curate the whole directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. I just actually thought of something, this is something that teenagers would also want to play with. I&#8217;m just thinking off the top of my head. I mean, a teen would want to play with something like this. There&#8217;s always been discussion in the community about how to get next generation into WordPress, get them using WordPress because they seem to like the newer social media channels. Because I know my daughter is always telling me, &#8220;Oh you&#8217;re not on TikTok, you don&#8217;t know what Snapchat is.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what those are.&#8221; So, I think this would also be a very good way to get them interested in WordPress, and if they like what they see, which I&#8217;m sure a lot of them would, that could also spur them to become WordPressers. I mean, that&#8217;s good, to get a future generation interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I like what you said as well, that it&#8217;s another way for people that don&#8217;t code to contribute. Yeah, it&#8217;s a second place. The first one was actually the WordPress Photos Directory where you can submit your photos that then could end up in one of the panels because the WordPress Photos Directory is also fed into the Openverse directory and Openverse is actually driving the media library in the patterns submission or pattern creator. So when you say, &#8220;Okay, I need an image.&#8221; You go to the Openverse and you can punch in a keyword like forest, or mountains, or blocks. Then you get a series of pictures that you can use on your block pattern. So, you don&#8217;t have to upload them, you don&#8217;t have to manage them. The people who use the pattern actually can also see the pictures without having to download them because they&#8217;re available on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s really a great integration on multiple levels. The repositories code is actually available on GitHub and you can see how you can learn or experiment with it, how the Openverse directory is added to the media library, also how block custom post types are actually handled by the block pattern directory, because any block pattern is a custom post type. So, if you want to learn that, you can look at the code and figure out how they deal with the custom post types. It&#8217;s actually a great tool on so many levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; take a shout out on that. Or speaking of testing and new features, Anne McCarthy just posted a new call for testing through the FSE, the Full Site Editing program. It&#8217;s all about authoring an author template, but she also writes that you create a template for your author pages, you learn how the locking UI for blocks works and it allows a site builder to prevent an editor to remove or move locked blocks. You also get to test the new design options and the new, no result block. If you have half an hour or so, spin up a new test site with local WP and follow Anne&#8217;s meticulous instructions. You have until April 21st to leave your feedback on the experience. So, I think I&#8217;m going to carve out a few minutes, well the half an hour, and participate in that because it&#8217;s a great way to learn the new features and also contribute by thinking through, &#8220;Okay, what do I feel? What do I see? Is there something that crashes my computer?&#8221; Or these kind of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s ahead of WordPress 6.0 release, that&#8217;s the best way to &#8230; or one of the few ways, to walk through some of the new features that will come to a WordPress instance near you soon. You have until April 21st to leave your feedback on the experience for the call for testing on FSE. If you&#8217;re more interested in watching other people walking through the current stage of WordPress 6.0, then join a panel on April 5th at 11:00 Eastern, 15:00 UTC, and you will hear from Channing Ritter, she&#8217;s a designer on the WordPress project, Hector Prieto and Matias Ventura, both developers on the Gutenberg plugin and the event will be moderated by Daisy Olsen and Dan Sulchin on April 5th, put it in your calendars. We have the link to the announcement post on May Core in the show notes. That&#8217;s also because the Zoom link where it&#8217;s going to happen will be shared on the Make blog, but it&#8217;s on Tuesday, April 5th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are listening to this episode after April 5th, I&#8217;m sure there will be a recording and it will be also shared on the post where that recording will live. So, going through the link will also benefit you who have not listened to this in time to get to the live show. So, that&#8217;s for you too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 5.9.3 and Gutenberg 12.9</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we come to the section of what&#8217;s released and a 5.9.3 security maintenance update is coming to you. The release candidate is out and the scheduled release is on Tuesday, also April 5th. There are nine bug fixes on Core and nine bug fixes from the block editor that come to your 5.9 instance, and of course, the security features that are coming as well. Now it&#8217;s your turn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: So, now we can talk about the features, the new features that are coming in this release, yes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: This is Gutenberg 12.9 release. Yes, yes, we are. Gutenberg 12.9 is out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Okay, awesome. So, the Block Editor has introduced what they call the block lock in UI, which allows the admin to have more control over the blocks, if you don&#8217;t want &#8230; maybe if you have built a site and you don&#8217;t want the editor, or the other to be to move around the blocks or rearrange your design, you can now lock those blocks. The post-date block now allows the user to pick a site default. So, the post-date block also now allows the users to pick their date format. This is great because you can now pick a date format for that post-block that is independent of the site&#8217;s defaults. You can select this and create your own individual format string. For instance, I&#8217;ve noticed most, I think the US date format is the day, the month and the year, I think. Whenever I look at these dates, I know that I get confused, because for us, it&#8217;s the other way round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s certainly one thing. It&#8217;s actually quite nifty because the person who creates the post can actually select the date, so it could &#8230; even outside of the site default, or you have an individual format. So, that&#8217;s quite helpful. And yeah, I know what you&#8217;re saying. I confuse everybody with dates, especially when I&#8217;m talking to Europe. So, most of the time I start with the year, month, and day, just to be sure, or I use the month and then the day and the year, so put the month and like April 5th, or not 4/5 because it could also be 5/4, especially &#8230; So, only in October, November, December, it&#8217;s relatively clear that it&#8217;s &#8230; or what is it? No, after the 12th of the month, it&#8217;s relatively clear what format is here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right and there is a no results block container now available for the query block. It&#8217;s the first iteration and it follows the idea that if there are no posts available for a certain criteria that the template has, that it should show some notification and that the site owner could modify that notification, or that saying, there are no blocks with that kind of criteria. It&#8217;s a first iteration but try it out. It might help with the theme development quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In with 12.9, there are some great enhancements on the list view. So now, you can actually &#8230; multiple select on the list view is now available and it supports the shift plus for Home and the End keys. So you can navigate through it by using the keyboard shortcuts that you know also from &#8230; Page Down, Page Up, from earlier days in the computer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us actually have muscle memory for those and now it&#8217;s great that we can use it in the list view. But even more helpful is the collapsed list view by default of the editor. So if you have, I don&#8217;t know, 30 blocks in your post or page and you open the list view, it also is now &#8230; everything is collapsed. So, if you have a group block, it only shows the group block, but when you click on it to extend, you&#8217;ll see what blocks are inside the group block or same with a cover block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you get a compressed version on the list view, and you can easily and better navigate that. So, all nodes are collapsed and the initial impact on heavy nested pages is reduced, reducing the cognitive load, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there was a nice feature and I don&#8217;t know how critical that is, but when you have a color palette and as a user, you create a new color that you want to make available through all the color selectors throughout the site, so you can add a blue and you can change actually the label that is displayed in the list of which color is selected. So, that&#8217;s quite nifty to actually put in, because then as a theme developer or a site owner, you can make clear it&#8217;s not a blue, it&#8217;s the brand blue, or it&#8217;s the sale-able blue, or whatever your lingo is in your own company to identify the colors of your brand. So, I think that&#8217;s a nice quality of life kind of feature, and it helps reduce the worry of which color is it that we want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of controls, there&#8217;s also now to the number control in this release was added the minimal and maximum font size for the tag cloud block. So now you can say, so the smaller size is six and the largest size is 25, or something like that through all your tag cloud. That is now pretty precise. Yeah, that wasn&#8217;t available before, but people knew it from the classic editor or the classic widget section, when you selected a tag cloud, those choices were actually available. It&#8217;s glad that this is back and on feature parity with the previous versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, the gallery block got a little easier now because you can control the gutter, or the space between the images. You can make them all together, or have a nice little space in between, and from zero white space to a large art gallery, kind of style gaps. With that, you also can have different layouts for your gallery images. I&#8217;m thinking that would be actually quite a nice experiment for block patterns to figure out additional ways to style the gallery block and have different ideas on how to make it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The separator block received a refactor on the color support. So, now you can have different colors, but also with different views. For designers, that&#8217;s very important to make sure that the separator block is also within the design. Back to you, Mary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Thank you for that, Birgit. So, the post editor also got some enhancement. First is the show view per view link for drafts saved on snackbar notice. This aims to make previewing a post, more visible and more consistent so that the auto always drafts and a post can easily preview their posts as the link to preview their posts in the snackbar notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The snackbar notices are the black little notices that are on the bottom of the screen when you save things. So you would say, &#8220;Okay, post is saved,&#8221; and then you had to go up and preview. So now, you can do it from the bottom of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. Do you know sometimes I have to click twice just because I want to quickly go down to click on the links?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: So, this is a good one. Thank you for your time for this. The site editor also now, you can add more template types as the site editor. Previously, when creating new templates in the site editor, we linked that to a more site of template types. Now you&#8217;re able to create a template for many different types of pages as you would need on your website. So, the theme exports, so now you can also export the whole theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, what kind of pages I can do category pages and I can do author pages, taxonomy, dates, tags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Tags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; and attachment pages? Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, yes, great. Still on the site editor, you can also now export the old theme. I believe there is second feedback for this, to see if this is going to be a helpful tool or not. So, it&#8217;ll be good if more people can test this out and comment and let them know if this is a tool that would be helpful for site builders or not, okay?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: So, you can also export a theme using the name for this ZIP file. This is done so that it makes it easier to add a theme to your WordPress install. So, this is also a good one because I know that in the past when I export themes, it usually has these random numbers on it and then you have to the name, if you plan to import that or install that on the site. There&#8217;s a concern that supporting the old theme might mean that the size would be bigger, but like I said, it&#8217;ll be great to have people test out these features and comment to let the builders know if this is something that would be very useful for them to add or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, if you find something quirky, definitely file an issue on the GitHub repository, or just ping me and I&#8217;ll walk you through it, if there&#8217;s something happening. Even if it&#8217;s not part of the call for testing for FSE, there is a Slack channel in WordPress Slack, that is the FSE outreach dash experiment. Yeah, experiment. That&#8217;s where site builders actually come together to discuss certain things. Now there will be some more traffic and some more conversation happening, now that another call for testing is out. It will also be additional information coming out because the call for questions that Anne had put out four weeks ago, I think, just closed the week. So, she&#8217;s working on getting answers to your questions and she will post that also at the Full Site Editing program Slack channel probably, and of course also in the Make blog of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>New APIs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the block library, there are new APIs in this release for the block patterns, is one that it automatically loads the file with headers, from a theme pattern directory. So, as a theme developer, you can, now &#8230; You don&#8217;t have to create a PHP file with all the patterns in there. Now, you just copy and paste the pattern that you built and put it into an HTML file and just store it in the directory called patterns and the editor will pick it up. So, it will show up in the inserter. If you use it a block template, it will also show up there for that. So, that&#8217;s certainly another way to simplify the whole theme production workflow. It&#8217;s similar to templates and template parts, the directory structure, where you pick up the templates and whether the editor picks up the templates list and the list of template parts from the directory and now you can do it with patterns, so really easy to follow along.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were some, two &#8230; we didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of experiments lately in the Gutenberg plugin, but now there are a few, again &#8230; Well, two, actually. One is a generic avatar block for authors. So, if the author, like the comment or the editor that created a post, doesn&#8217;t have an avatar on site, or in Gravatar, you actually control what the generic avatar is going to be. Then there&#8217;s also a new version of the list block implemented as a nested block and transformed, and also has a few PRs in there that are all around the refactor of the list block, because it&#8217;s been said quite a bit, that there is no inner block, so you couldn&#8217;t have an image in a list block where you couldn&#8217;t have quote in a list block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is going to change and you can enable those by going through the experiment section and click on the list block there. Yeah, so it&#8217;s implement the nested block behavior, transform the list for the list block. And then also change the start number, the order and the reverse list block attributes, also for a nested block list. Yeah, those are the things in the experiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also some great changes in the documentation. You can read up about them in the release documentation. There was quite a few things for code quality and the tools, but I don&#8217;t see anything that I would want to point out, except that they&#8217;re adding now the infrastructure for writing end-to-end tests in a different library or different format. It&#8217;s called Playwright instead of &#8230; what&#8217;s the other one? Puppeteer, yeah. Justin Anyon had a Make blog about that, so I&#8217;ll share the note in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg Block Examples Repo 1.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that concludes the Gutenberg plugin 12.9 change log for today. There was also another release. So 5.9.3 release candidate, and then Gutenberg 12.9. Ryan Welcher released a new version of the Gutenberg Examples repo and it&#8217;s now in version 1.1. That Examples repo has examples for a lot of different blocks, with a lot of different settings and controls. You can really learn from that how the various items work, so you can replicate it in your blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was quite a bit behind because the blocks haven&#8217;t been migrated to the new API that uses the block JSON. So it was not really teaching the best practices or the newer way to do this, but now that has changed. This is definitely a major update, so this plugin includes completely updated block examples, as well as new non-block examples, comprises of 40 PRs by eight contributors, and it&#8217;s actually were the first release since the start of the repo in 2018. How to use it, you the instructions are in the README file. So yeah, go ahead and learn and check it out. Of course, if you have any questions, send them our way. We try to all answer that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development and Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to the section of what&#8217;s an active development and discussed. Dennis Snell, and he&#8217;s one of the core contributors on Gutenberg development since the beginning. He had a proposal on a concept of dynamic token in Core, and the GitHub discussion link will be in the show notes. But this goes back to the preliminary roadmap of Gutenberg phase two for 6.0, that Matius Ventura published on the Make Core blog. He wrote, “As one of those things that are supposed to come, is explore the viability of inline tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This has come up repeatedly in the content of rendering dynamic strings, such as the current date in rich text blocks.” Snell wrote then on that proposal, &#8220;One area the block model has been deficient however, is in establishing more granular semantic types of inline content that carry meaning, not associated with a block. These inline semantic parts represent content or metadata that comes from outside the document being edited and may be relatively static or highly dynamic.&#8221; He continues to outline the character of the token concept. He offers us code examples of possible how this going to work with in different context with the block JSON example, a save and edit example, and then the token execution, maybe in a PHP file. Dear listeners, if you feel that this all rings like Shortcodes, you are not wrong. It definitely would be the Shortcode 2.0, which are much better interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Okay. So, still on active development and what&#8217;s discussed in a newest design share Channing Ritter highlights a merit of design the team is working on. This could use your input and critique. Under the headline, &#8220;Status and visibility panel improvements,&#8221; she links to a prototype you can browse the aspirations to improve, the publish and posts matter in panel. Birgit, you noted here that you enjoy the various views of how the panels could look, as much cleaner and clearer too and so you can….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: So, you can browse the prototype. We&#8217;re going to put a link to that in the show notes. There are other highlights that are also interesting, such as adding the post-category templates, the page start options, star version, over animation, icons for groups through and stack, new blocks, comment query loops design, default design. All of this is work in progress and soon to come to a Gutenberg plug-in near you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the stack new block, because it should give control on how your group block behaves with different screen sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so thank you everyone. I think that is the end of our show. No, I know so. Yeah, before we end the show, I want to remind everybody, April 5th is the walk-through on the features, where the three Channing Ritter, Hector Prieto, Matias Ventura walk through all the features and figure out, &#8220;Okay, is this good enough or is it &#8230; &#8221; Yeah, &#8220;What&#8217;s coming in and do we find still bugs?&#8221; So, there will also be a note taker, April 1st, 11:00 AM Eastern and 15:00 UTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on the gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 64. If you have questions, or suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Well, it&#8217;s so great to see you again, Mary, and thank you for having this conversation with me. Well, until the next time, dear listeners, thank you for staying with us through the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, thank you everyone. And thank you for bearing with my audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: wpafrica.org, if you are on the continent and want to meet more WordPressers. Yeah, check out the site. That&#8217;s it, thank you for listening.

This also just happened to coincide with the first November I had ever completed <a href=\"https://nanowrimo.org/\">National Novel Writing Month</a>, a 30-day challenge to write a 50,000-word first draft of a novel. I have since won a second time in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a starry-eyed, wanna-be novelist, one of the first things that excited me about the block system was how writers could show off their books with WordPress. Of course, I had no choice but to create a custom grouping of blocks to show off the manuscript I had somehow managed to hammer out in a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Homepage design of theme for novelists.\n\n\n\n<p>This was the pre-pattern era of WordPress. The interface was clunky. Things seemed to break at random. Design tools were almost non-existent, but there was a bit of magic in the air. At no point in the platform&#8217;s history could users visually build such a simple layout with stock WordPress. For all its faults during the beta run, this was the moment that I became a block fanboy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not until months later that I released the theme for novelists &#8212; it was a child of another project that had yet to launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this entry in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/building-with-blocks\">Building with Blocks series</a>, I wanted to walk readers through creating one of the patterns that inspired me to continue designing and developing with the block system. As a bonus, I will also show how to create a book review pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/archeo/\">Archeo theme</a> by Automattic throughout this tutorial. However, it should work with any theme that supports blocks. You will also get more mileage out of a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Book Card</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This card is meant to be a starting point for authors who want to showcase one of their books, but it could be applied to any product. There are 1,000s of ways you could alter this, and I encourage everyone to customize it once they have walked through the steps. The end result should look similar to the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Final book card design.\n\n\n\n<p>The final block HTML code is <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/justintadlock/fc776ca766fe789dcc317e83c6b5f15f\">available via Gist</a>. You can copy and paste it into the editor, but I encourage you to try building from scratch the first go-round. This series is all about learning to build with blocks. The copy-ready code is there just in case you get stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Container Group (optional)</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Group block with padding and colors.\n\n\n\n<p>Almost as a rule, I start with a Group block when building patterns or sections of blocks. I chose to add it this time because I wanted a dark background with some padding around the card&#8217;s content. You may opt-out of this if you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the block is in place, add text color, background color, and padding to the block. I chose <code>2rem</code> for the padding because my active theme&#8217;s default is not consistent on all sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Adding Media</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Media &amp; Text block inside of a Group.\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite blocks in WordPress is Media &amp; Text. It has so many use cases, and it is sort of like a mini pattern all on its own. On one side, you drop in your media. On the other, you add whatever content you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the Group block from Step 1, insert Media &amp; Text. Go ahead and grab an image of your choosing. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/\">WordPress photo directory</a> has plenty if you do not have one on hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only alteration I made to this block is to set the &#8220;Media width&#8221; option to <code>35</code> in the block options sidebar. Depending on the dimensions of your image, you may choose another option. Just be sure to give room for your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Group (optional)</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding an inner Group block.\n\n\n\n<p>Inside of the Media &amp; Text block, I added another Group. It enables consistent spacing, which WordPress does not apply to the &#8220;content&#8221; area of the Media &amp; Text block for some reason. This is an optional step, but it provides more control over the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not feel good with the spacing of your theme, you can change the &#8220;Block spacing&#8221; option in the block options sidebar. I adjusted this to <code>2rem</code>, but it will depend on the active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside, these are details I rarely see mentioned in other tutorials&#8212;the &#8220;gotchas&#8221; and other problems that you might encounter. I feel like they are helpful inclusions but can be a bit of a bore. Feel free to let me know in the comments if you want me to continue covering this level of detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 4: Card Content</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding Heading, Paragraph, and Buttons blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>The final step in creating the book card should be relatively straightforward. I included a Heading, two Paragraphs, and a Buttons block. I encourage experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made no changes to the Heading and Paragraph blocks. However, I selected the &#8220;Outline&#8221; style for the lone Button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, that is it! The inclusion of the built-in Media &amp; Text block made it easier than building with others. Continue reading if you prefer reviewing books to writing and selling them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Book Review Intro Card</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This walkthrough will take you through creating a book review (or review intro) card. Like before, you can snag the full <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/justintadlock/86f0a4d532dfd420d1c198d967c18408\">block HTML from Gist</a>. The result should look a little something like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Final book review card intro design.\n\n\n\n<p>With all the fuss over the previous <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-build-a-recipe-card-via-the-wordpress-block-editor\">recipe card tutorial</a>, let me preface this section with a quick note. This tutorial series is about learning to build with blocks, not creating fleshed-out solutions for every possible scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those folks who want more, there are existing solutions. Donna Peplinskie&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/book-review-block/\">Book Review Block</a> is an excellent choice. It has ISBN integration, review Schema, and plenty of other bells and whistles. I even <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-the-book-review-block-plugin\">wrote about it back in 2020</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is for the <em>sometimes</em> book reviewers, people not starting a review site, or those who just want to pick up a tip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Steps 1-3: Rinse and Repeat</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a Group, Media &amp; Text, and another Group block.\n\n\n\n<p>These steps are literally the same as the book card above: add a Group block, add Media &amp; Text, and nest another Group inside the content area. The only change I made was to widen the Media section to <code>40</code> (it was <code>35</code> before).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to mix this up and try new things. Skip the initial Group block if you do not want the padded background.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 4: Card Content</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a Heading, List, and Quote block.\n\n\n\n<p>Like the earlier book card, add a Heading block for the book title. This goes within the Group nested inside of the Media &amp; Text block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next part of the content is where things divert. For the book &#8220;info,&#8221; you must insert a List block. Then, fill in the details that you think are relevant, like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/270d.png\" alt=\"✍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Written by Justin Tadlock</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f516.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Tagged Adult Fiction</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4da.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Published by Words &amp; Press</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4c5.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Published on May 01, 2099</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4c3.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> 599 Pages</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" alt=\"⭐\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" alt=\"⭐\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" alt=\"⭐\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" alt=\"⭐\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" alt=\"⭐\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> / 5 Stars</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to spice things up with a few emoji. If that is not your thing, there is no need to include them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a real-world project, I would also include a &#8220;no marker&#8221; style for the List block, allowing the emoji to act as <em>faux</em> bullet points. However, the theme I was testing with did not have a style for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the final section. I like to kick off book reviews by including a favorite quote. It gets me in the mood for writing about the book and lets me share something from the author. Therefore, I opted for placing a Quote block as the final piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative might be a quick summary. You might even simply dive right into the review from there or leave the space empty. It is your card, and you can do what you want with it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 02 Apr 2022 03:41:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"Gutenberg Times: Future of Themes is here, Block Examples updated and a Walk-Through – Weekend Edition #209\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=20826\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/future-of-themes-is-here-block-examples-updated-and-a-walk-through-weekend-edition-209/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15448:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week went fast, didn&#8217;t it?

It&#8217;s a walk-through the differences to classic editor, and the various interfaces that come with the block editor. It&#8217;s also a great link to point people, too, that just want to  learn more before they make the jump from Classic Editor to the Block Editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building Themes for the block editor and Full-site editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rich Tabor</strong>, product manager at Extendify, thinks &#8220;<a href=\"https://richtabor.com/a-new-era/\">A new era of WordPress themes is finally here</a>&#8220;. In his post he explains the four concepts, what makes a block theme different from classic themes. He continues to ouline the Future of Theme development: &#8220;It’s more apparent than ever to me that the barriers of theme development are slowly becoming smaller and smaller. There may always be some level of technical skillset required to produce phenomenal block themes, but generally speaking designing, assembling and launching a theme has never been easier.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developing for the Block Editor and Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On GitHub Discussions, <strong>Dennis Snell</strong> posted a proposal on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/39831\"><strong>concept of dynamic Token in Core</strong></a> in a the GitHub discussion post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This goes back to the preliminary roadmap for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/26/preliminary-roadmap-for-6-0/\">Gutenberg phase 2 post for 6.0</a> by <strong>Matias Ventura</strong> when he wrote: “Explore the viability of inline tokens. This has come up repeatedly in the context of rendering dynamic strings (such as current date) in rich text blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snell wrote: “One area the block model has been deficient, however, is in establishing more granular semantic types of &#8220;inline&#8221; content that carry meaning not associated with a block. These inline semantic parts represent content or metadata that comes from outside the document being edited and may be relatively static or highly dynamic.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then outlines the Token concept, followed by code examples.  He shows the usage in different context, for in block.json, save and edit space and the token execution in a PHP file. And if you feel this all rings like Shortcodes, you are not wrong. It definitely would be Shortcode 2.0 with a much better interface.  <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/39831\">Check it out and let your opinion known.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rich Tabor</strong> released <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/blocks-on-github/\">all his personal plugins on GitHub</a>.

These products range from newly in beta to fully launched. Some are banking on the freemium model and others are fully commercial products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>APPExperts Mobile Application Builder Plugin Now in Beta</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://appexperts.io/\">APPExperts</a> is a new mobile application builder plugin that is now in beta, developed by the WPExperts team. It turns WordPress and WooCommerce websites into fully functional apps for  iOS and Android phones, tablets, and other mobile devices. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/appexperts/\">plugin on WordPress.org</a> functions as a connector to the APPExperts platform, which is powered by <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\">Flutter</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Users can create their first app for free and the commercial version includes additional features like push notifications, ads integration, and plugin integrations.  APPExperts is going up against more established competitors like <a href=\"https://apppresser.com/\">AppPresser</a>, which bills annually for the use of its platform. During its pre-beta period, APPExperts added 500 users on its connector plugin who generated more than 1,000 apps for iOS and Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WP Wallet Organizes Commercial Theme and Plugin Licenses Into a Single Dashboard</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpwallet.com/\">WP Wallet</a> is a new product, created by the team behind MasterWP, that helps WordPress site owners keep track of their license keys for commercial themes and plugins. The idea is to prevent users from missing license renewals, losing license keys, and struggling with invoicing. The service scans each website added to the account and retrieves any commercial license subscription fees, capturing any administrative details. It can also send invoices for payment via PayPal or Stripe with no transaction fees. Everything related to commercial licenses is organized into a single dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WP Wallet is free forever for up to three websites and is supported by ads. Free users can share access with unlimited team members and connect to Stripe or PayPal. <a href=\"https://wpwallet.com/pricing/\">Upgrading to Pro</a> is less than $10 per month and allows users to add unlimited sites, connect multiple payment gateways, and will soon include a Chrome Extension and API.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Styles Plugin Now in Beta, Brings Advanced Styles to the Block Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blockstyles.com/\">Block Styles</a> is a new plugin now in beta that lets users further customize core blocks with unique styles. It <a href=\"https://blockstyles.com/compatibility/\">works with many popular block collection plugins</a> and boasts &#8220;fully responsive block-level design control.&#8221; This allows users to change style attributes based on desktop, tablet, and mobile sizes, and eventually customer device sizes, hover/action states and pseudo elements. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Styles plugin has advanced layout controls with visibility settings that can be set based on user role, device size, and login status. It also adds the ability to customize the background of every Gutenberg block with colors, gradient options, and linear and radial settings. The team is working on adding multiple backgrounds and video backgrounds. The plugin has support for advanced border styles, typography controls, special effects, animations, and custom CSS for every block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing for the Block Styles plugin ranges from $69/year for one site to $499/year for unlimited sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stock Control for WooCommerce Makes It Easier to Manage Inventory</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scwstockcontrol.com/\">Stock Control for WooCommerce</a> is a new plugin that launched this week, created by plugin developer Edith Allison. It makes it easier to manage WooCommerce inventory and make quick adjustments. Store owners can manipulate stock, and change descriptions, images, attributes, and categories all on one page. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Product changes can be published immediately or saved for review later. The plugin also logs who made the changes and when. It uses the Heartbeat API to monitor the shop and will notify if there is an editing conflict with another site manager. It will also notify if stock quantities change while the site owner is working on the products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stock Control for WooCommerce starts at €29,90/year for single site licenses and goes up to €149,90/year for agencies. The roadmap for future updates includes more translations, an attribute manager, bulk actions, scheduled publication of changes, compatibility with Woo Product Bundles, and a way to show &#8220;held&#8221; stock.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Apr 2022 21:22:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Post Status: BobWP’s Woo Snippet for the Week of March 27\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95330\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/bobwps-woo-snippet-for-the-week-of-march-27/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6156:\"<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">WooCommerce 6.4 RC 1 <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4e6.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Blocks and Admin <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f50c.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Time to Retire ZeroClipboard <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/26a0.png\" alt=\"⚠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Clients in a Candy Store <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f36c.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sustainable Woo? <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1fab4.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Zach Stepek, Carl Alexander, Till Krüss, and JJJ <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p></div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-s-new-in-woocommerce-6-4-rc1-blocks-and-admin-feature-plugins\">What\'s New in WooCommerce 6.4 RC1 + Blocks and Admin Feature Plugins <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f50c.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week saw some updates from core and <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/03/29/woocommerce-6-4-rc/\">the release</a> of <strong>WooCommerce 6.4 RC 1</strong>. We\'re still headed for an April 12th final release. <strong>WooCommerce Admin</strong> (3.3.0 RC 2) and <strong>WooCommerce Blocks</strong> (7.2.1) are both included in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install it separately as a feature plugin, <strong>WooCommerce Blocks 7.3</strong> <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/03/28/woocommerce-blocks-7-3-0-release-notes/\">is available now</a>. The <strong>Mini Cart</strong> block has been added to it, and all instances of the “Legacy Block” have been renamed — it\'s now the “Classic Block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Time to Retire ZeroClipboard <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/26a0.png\" alt=\"⚠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have bundled the <strong>ZeroClipboard</strong> library with plugins, themes, or other projects that still rely on it as a dependency, <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/03/30/removal-of-zeroclipboard/\">you will need to find another solution</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4cb.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZeroClipboard is a <strong>JQuery</strong> plugin used to manage clipboard interactions, and it\'s being removed from WooCommerce because it uses obsolete, potentially insecure, Flash-based methods to do what all browsers can do natively now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years now, it\'s been possible to do what ZeroClipBoard does without JQuery. <strong>Marcus Burnette</strong> has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcusdburnette/status/1509214884327825415\">suggested</a> a fine <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/native-browser-copy-clipboard/\">solution</a> from <strong>Chris Coyier</strong> back in 2016 at <strong>CSS Tricks</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Like Clients in a Candy Store <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f36c.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are starting to build sites in the Woo ecosystem, <strong>Eric Karkovack</strong> has  <a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/overcoming-the-challenge-of-selling-clients-on-woocommerce/\">some advice for selling clients on WooCommerce</a>. It can be difficult, due to the wide array of features and add-ons.

Or how eCommerce sites using WooCommerce might have their own unique challenges? It’s probably not something most site builders are thinking about, or even most hosting companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to <strong>Tom Greenwood</strong> from <strong>Wholegrain Digital</strong> will certainly <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/sustainable-web-design-now-and-in-the-future/\">open your eyes and make you more aware of the importance of sustainable websites</a>, both now and in the future. <strong>Kathy Zant</strong> and <strong>Ronal Gijsel</strong> sat down to talk with Tom in the latest <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/series/woocommerce/\">Do the Woo</a> podcast episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Four Developers and a Microphone <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And last but not least, there is that nagging question — <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-dev-chat-with-jjj/\">What happens when you get four developers together on a podcast?</a> Well, it depends.

They enjoy interacting with readers, getting real-time feedback, and seeing their community grow. However, while there are a lot of benefits to enabling comments on your WordPress website, you might run into a few problems along the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re on the fence about enabling comments, you’ve come to the right place. We’ll cover the pros and cons and discuss how you can protect your site from unwanted spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2365\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2>The pros of enabling comments on WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the potential risks comments pose, why do so many bloggers keep them around? Here are a few benefits to enabling comments on your site:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. They build a strong community&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind every successful WordPress website is a group of loyal followers. Enabling comments on your website allows people to share stories, connect with like-minded readers, and gain a sense of ownership and pride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you can’t respond to every comment, your audience members will feel acknowledged and appreciated when they see that you’re reading and engaging with fellow followers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. You can receive valuable feedback</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The comments section of your website gives visitors an easy way to leave feedback on your site. Much of this will come naturally. If a post sees substantially more comments than normal and a plethora of positive responses, it’s a good indication that the subject matter really resonated with your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking the following questions could help solicit feedback from your readers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you like this style of post? Do you want to see more or less?</li><li>What other topics would you like me to cover?&nbsp;</li><li>What are the most common problems you encounter with (the subject matter of your site)?&nbsp;</li><li>What’s the most helpful advice you’ve seen on this site?&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By asking direct questions, you can better gauge if you’re serving your audience well. And when readers feel acknowledged and see that you take action based on their feedback, they’ll have a greater sense of loyalty and ownership. This is a key part of developing brand advocates that will proactively share your site with their friends and family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. You can increase views and conversions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a person leaves a comment on your website and you or another reader replies, they’ll come back to view that response. Imagine if every commenter visited your website multiple times to reply to comments. Your page views would go through the roof!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With commenters regularly returning to your site, the increase in page views could bump up ad revenue or improve the chances that they take a desired action —&nbsp;register for your email list, purchase a product, leave you a tip, follow you on social media, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The cons of enabling comments on WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While enabling comments on your website seems to be a great choice, remember that everything has two sides. Now that we’ve covered the benefits of comments, let’s examine the&nbsp;potential downsides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Moderating comments is time-consuming&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While getting feedback and connecting with your audience is great, moderating comments is a time-consuming process. You’ll need to read each comment, formulate a response, and do your best to keep spam comments at bay. You might be able to handle it when your blog has a few readers, but as your audience grows, comments can quickly get out of hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. You may attract unwanted spam&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the moment you enable comments on your website, spambots will come running. You can get hit with a wave of bot-generated comments&nbsp;even if your audience is small. While there are ways to <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/12/how-to-stop-comment-spam-in-wordpress/\">protect your WordPress site from comment spam</a>, dealing with spam is one of the many responsibilities that fall under site management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. They could negatively affect your brand&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how hard you try, you can’t make everyone happy. There will always be people who disagree with you or aren’t big fans of your content. This can be emotionally exhausting, but also make others wonder about the validity of your work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malicious comments with links that lead to viruses or other nefarious traps could harm your visitors and cause distrust and frustration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a comment section that’s filled with gibberish spam remarks, lewd or obscene comments, or even no comments at all can make readers associate your site with bad feelings. Allowing each and every comment with no moderation is an express lane to a tarnished reputation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The SEO benefits of enabling comments on WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloggers put a lot of work into search engine optimization (SEO). With all the hours that go into creating content, it’s natural that they want people to see and read the fruits of their labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has made it clear that <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-removing-blog-comments-may-impact-search-rankings/395400/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comments can have a positive impact on search rankings</a>. Let’s look at three SEO benefits of enabling comments on your website:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Increased natural keyword density&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When search engines crawl your site, they’re looking, in part, to understand what each page is about, based on the content it contains. When your readers comment and mention the keywords you’re trying to rank your blog post for, search engines will take notice and may give your rankings a boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially true when it comes to semantically similar keywords. These are search terms closely related to the keywords you’re targeting. Imagine you wrote a blog post on chocolate cake. While “chocolate cake” is your main keyword, words like “icing,” “gluten-free,” “recipe,” and “ingredients” are all semantically similar keywords that help improve your content’s relevance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While search engines don’t appreciate, and will even penalize, stuffing your page full of keywords, organic comments can do the work for you while staying on search engines’ ‘good side.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. More webpage content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To Google and other search engines, the comment section of your website is simply additional content. Your blog post could only be 600 words long, but if you have 800 words worth of comments, you now have 1,400 words of content on your page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, these comments need to add to the value of your blog post. On the other hand, long comments unrelated to the post could have the opposite effect. This is why comment moderation, although time-consuming, is essential.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. More linking opportunities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments on a WordPress website increase linking opportunities — both internal and external. Answering questions in your comment section gives you the chance to link to relevant articles on your website, giving visitors a reason to stay on your site longer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even referring to third-party sites when a question goes beyond the scope of your expertise can help search engines better understand the full context of your site and where it fits in the online ecosystem. Plus, honest referrals to other experts is a great way to build a relationship with sites who may return the favor in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to disable WordPress comments&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to either disable comments on individual pages of your WordPress site or disable them across the entire site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to disable comments on your entire WordPress website</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To completely disable comments on your site, navigate to your dashboard and go to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Discussion</strong>. Look for <strong>Default post settings</strong> at the top of your screen. Uncheck the box that says <strong>Allow people to comment on new posts</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h3>How to disable comments on individual pages&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you want to disable comments only on specific pages? You might notice that some blog topics or articles are more prone to spam than others. To disable those comment sections, go to the <strong>Posts</strong> or <strong>Pages</strong> tab. Find the post or page you’re looking for and click on <strong>Quick edit</strong> below its name. Next, you’ll see a box that reads <strong>Allow Comments</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If the box is checked, disable it. You can repeat this process across your website for all the pages and posts where you want to turn off comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that depending on the nature of your blog, disabling comments on your website could cost you valuable engagement. Thankfully, you can take steps to avoid spam comments on your website without sacrificing your comment section entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An overview of comment spam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the benefits of robust reader engagement without the annoyance of dangerous spam, there are some steps you can take to prevent comment spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What spam comments look like</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spam comments are often easy to spot. Since bots behave according to how they’re programmed, they tend to follow a few general guidelines. Here are warning signs a comment might be spam:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The message leads readers to a third-party website that’s unrelated to the subject matter of the post</li><li>The comment comes from a guest account or one with no name&nbsp;</li><li>There is no user avatar/profile picture&nbsp;</li><li>There are direct mentions of products and services</li><li>The comment is unrelated to the blog topic or comment discussion&nbsp;</li><li>The comment is rife with grammatical errors or gibberish that doesn’t contribute to meaningful discussion</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you run a blog that caters to dessert recipes. A spam comment posted by a bot might look something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“Find out how to keep your Air conditioners clean all year round here!!! → (insert link)”</strong> &#8211; <strong>Guest 0123r67</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vague name and unrelated comment are clear signs of spam, so the comment should be removed as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why spam comments are harmful</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From the moment you allow comments on your site, you’re bound to attract some spam. As your content and audience grow, this spam can become overwhelming to manage while the number of people who could be impacted increases. Let’s review a few of the reasons why spam comments are harmful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Spam comments foster distrust with your readers&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do spam comments make your site look unprofessional, they foster distrust with your readers. No matter how credible a website looks, a comment section riddled with spam will raise red flags among visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some people may understand that spam comments are a natural occurrence, others may not be so understanding. This is especially true if they fall prey to following a link from one of these comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, if you choose to enable comments on your site, it’s your job to monitor them and keep your followers safe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Spam comments ruin the user experience&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Followers looking to have real, meaningful conversations with other readers will be put off by bots taking over the comment section.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you sit back and let spam comments wreak havoc across your website, you miss out on valuable feedback, suggestions, and potential connections with your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Spam comments impact your SEO</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to delete low-quality comments could severely harm your site’s search engine rankings. You’ve put months, maybe even years of hard work into your website, but letting comments build up with links to malicious sites can undo much of your progress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to avoid spam comments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide that it’s worth it to have comments on your WordPress website, remember that the best defense is a good offense. Don’t wait for your website to become overrun with spam comments before investing in a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">spam-fighting plugin like Akismet</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet can automatically detect spam on your website by sifting through comments and separating the good from the bad. Within seconds, Akismet analyzes the comments submitted to your site and runs them through their global database. If a comment is flagged, it won’t get posted — plain and simple.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One major benefit of Akismet is the time it saves you when moderating comments. Instead of viewing every comment submission manually, you only need to check the ones that Akismet flags as potential spam. Or, you can just let it get rid of the worst spam without having to review it at all!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you allow comments on your website?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t make the decision for you, so you’ll need to weigh the risks and benefits of comments on your website yourself. While building a rapport with your audience and using comments to improve SEO may be worth it for some, the need to constantly moderate comments for spam may put others off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re really on the fence about enabling comments on your site, you can always try it out with a spam-fighting plugin like <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>.

If you find that they do more harm than good, you can always disable them and try again in the future.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Apr 2022 08:16:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WebMan Design Launches Abs, Additional Styles for Native WordPress Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132209\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/webman-design-launches-abs-additional-styles-for-native-wordpress-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4505:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WebMan Design owner Oliver Juhas released the first version of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/additional-block-styles/\">Abs &#8211; Additional block styles plugin</a> on Monday. Unlike many block-related extensions, it does not offer any blocks of its own. Instead, it registers custom styles to enhance those packaged with core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the plugin adds 18 styles. Some are specific to a single block, such as Accessibility Hidden, which creates invisible Headings, making them available to screen readers. Others, such as the Drop Shadow style, are registered for multiple blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, it is a well-rounded set that often leans into more practical use cases. The Overlap Above and Overlap Below styles fit into this scenario. The former allows users to bump Image, Cover, and other blocks up, overlapping the section above them. The latter goes in the opposite direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Image overlapping section above it.\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to such overlaps is that the user cannot control how far up or down the block shifts. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32644\">Negative vertical margin controls</a> are a sought-after feature in WordPress, often necessary to create specialized layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juhas provided a <code>--abs_overlap_value</code> CSS custom property. DIY users could control this via CSS. At the very least, theme authors could integrate directly with the plugin. However, they may simply want to register the styles for their own themes if going through all the trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the plugin styles may be practical in many ways, Juhas also threw a bit of whimsy in the mix. Almost as a signature, nearly every similar plugin offers at least one SVG mask for image-related blocks. Abs follows the same path with its Paint Brush style:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Paint Brush style applied to an image.\n\n\n\n<p>That is the only such SVG mask in the plugin, a style that has almost been overdone. At least the Paint Brush option breaks from the mold of &#8220;blob shapes&#8221; that have become commonplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juhas has several example screenshots and GIFs on the plugin page that explore what the plugin is capable of, many of them mixing and matching different blocks and styles. It is unlikely that I will do it justice here. However, I did try my hand at several layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite creations was mixing the Wavy style for the Media &amp; Text block with Zigzag for Separator:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Wavy style for Media &amp; Text with mix of Zigzag Separator blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>Abs also includes a Double Line option for the Separator block. But, the plugin shines the most with Media &amp; Text. I can only assume that Juhas looked at it and realized that not enough designers were doing anything interesting with it, taking the responsibility upon himself. <em>That is merely a guess, anyway.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin adds a Paint Brush style for Media &amp; Text as it does for other image-type blocks. It also has a Media on Top option for stacking the block&#8217;s contents on both desktop and mobile displays and a similar stacking option for tablets. It supports both the previously-mentioned overlapping styles. Plus, users can get some mileage from its Gradient variation, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Gradient style used for the Media &amp; Text block.\n\n\n\n<p>I am merely scratching the surface of possibilities with the plugin&#8217;s out-of-the-box styles. With time and creativity, users can create some unique layouts with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested Abs against several block-based themes, and it held up well. The only issues I ran into were likely related to running the latest Gutenberg plugin. After selecting a custom color when using the Zigzag style for the Separator block, the background color overtakes the shape. And, the alignment styles for the Column block do not align left or right in the editor. However, they do work on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a fan of plugins that offer custom styles, and Abs is a welcome departure from the carousel of block libraries. It has just enough variety to please those looking for business-friendly design options while not neglecting users who just want to have a little fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/additional-block-styles/\">Abs &#8211; Additional block styles</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Apr 2022 02:41:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: WP Migrate DB Rebrands to WP Migrate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132290\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-migrate-db-rebrands-to-wp-migrate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2782:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/\">WP Migrate DB</a>, a popular WordPress site migration plugin by Delicious Brains, has rebranded to WP Migrate with its latest <a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro-2-3-released/\">version 2.3 release</a>. The original name was always a bit of a mouthful but also became a less accurate representation of the plugin&#8217;s full capabilities as they grew over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This plugin has been capable of migrating more than just the database for a long time, so it&#8217;s nice to officially rebrand with an emphasis on full site WordPress migrations,&#8221; Delicious Brains Product Manager Kevin Hoffman said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Database-less migrations is one of the major features of the 2.3 release. No database tables are required anymore to migrate media, theme, and plugin files. The plugin added a new checkbox in the Database panel of users&#8217; migration profiles so they can choose if they want to include the database in the migration, just the files, or both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the introduction of database-less migrations in version 2.3, the time is right to officially &#8216;drop the DB&#8217; from our name and move forward as <em>WP Migrate</em>,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;This new name better suits the plugin that is now capable of migrating any combination of WordPress database tables, media files, uploads, themes, and plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Migrate Pro 2.3 also introduces the ability to migrate from one multisite to another, making it easy to migrate from subsite-to-subsite. The interface now has new indicators showing theme and plugin version differences. Users will find the plugin installation workflow much easier, as version 2.3 moves addon functionality into the core plugin. Separate plugins, such as the Media Files and Multisite Tools addons, will automatically deactivate because they are now included in the core plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/\">free version of WP Migrate</a>, which has 300,000 active installs on WordPress.org, has also been updated and includes the following changes for version 2.3: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New: “WP Migrate DB” is now “WP Migrate Lite”</li><li>New: CLI commands now support <code>migrate</code> base command as an alias of <code>migratedb</code></li><li>Improvement: CLI exports no longer require find/replace arguments</li><li>Improvement: Notices are now styled to reflect their state (success, error, warning, or information)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The WP Migrate team plans to release an expansion of these features in the next release, including the ability to migrate must-use plugins, languages, and third-party directories found within <code>wp-content</code>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:56:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Juan Aldasoro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12512\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/people-of-wordpress-juanfra-aldasoro/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16649:\"<p><strong>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better. This month we feature a website developer and product manager from Argentina, who found in the software a way to live his life in the way he dreamed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2333.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in front of a mural\" class=\"wp-image-12525\" />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress offers something to everyone. For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br /><br />“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br /><br />Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" />\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br /><br />By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" />\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" />\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

Basically, whenever there is a country dropdown, <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> may be what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Before we dive into WooCommerce again, here\'s a little historical context for the function we\'re going to look at this week: <code>get_european_union_countries</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community. The European Union was formally established with the Maastricht Treaty on 1 November 1993. There are now 27 EU members, yet <em>the list is always subject to change</em>. With Brexit, the United Kingdom left the EU. There is talk currently about Ukraine joining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, WooCommerce developers coded a function called <code>get_european_union_countries()</code>, which returns an array of &#8230; countries in the EU! (Did you see that coming?) Once again, we can rely on a lazy WooCommerce function and stop worrying about who is and who is not in the EU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why would you ever need to use <code>get_european_union_countries()</code>? Let\'s look at its syntax, its arguments, and some possible uses. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-94980\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-function-syntax\">Function Syntax</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the <code>european_union_countries()</code> function under <code>\\woocommerce\\includes\\class-wc-countries.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * Gets an array of countries in the EU.\n *\n * @param  string $type Type of countries to retrieve. Blank for EU member countries. eu_vat for EU VAT countries.\n * @return string&#91;]\n */\npublic function get_european_union_countries( $type = \'\' ) {\n	$countries = array( \'AT\', \'BE\', \'BG\', \'CY\', \'CZ\', \'DE\', \'DK\', \'EE\', \'ES\', \'FI\', \'FR\', \'GR\', \'HR\', \'HU\', \'IE\', \'IT\', \'LT\', \'LU\', \'LV\', \'MT\', \'NL\', \'PL\', \'PT\', \'RO\', \'SE\', \'SI\', \'SK\' );\n\n	if ( \'eu_vat\' === $type ) {\n		$countries&#91;] = \'MC\';\n	}\n\n	return apply_filters( \'woocommerce_european_union_countries\', $countries, $type );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s nothing very complex here — a hard-coded list of EU member country codes, and the function returns this array. Simple!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of important notes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The function accepts a parameter, <code>$type</code>. This can either be left blank or set to <code>\"eu_vat\"</code>, in which case <code>MC</code> would also be included in the returned list of countries for Monaco, which is not a EU member, but it <em>is</em> subject to European VAT/tax.</li><li>The function provides a filter hook, <code>woocommerce_european_union_countries</code>, which you can use in your customization should you need to remove or add countries to the list.  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s imagine you need to get a list of European countries — you\'d notice many are not in the list as they don\'t belong to the EU. This includes Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vatican City. With the <code>woocommerce_european_union_countries</code> filter you can add them and return the full list of European countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you wondering if this is a political history post or a WooCommerce development tutorial? I don\'t blame you. Let\'s look at the case studies I promised to show how <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> might be used in a real-world scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Case Studies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> useful to WooCommerce devleopers? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, first of all it\'s important to understand why WooCommerce has this function and what it uses it for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing a quick file search through the WooCommerce plugin, we can see <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> is called at least 3 times:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The <code>get_vat_countries()</code> function merges the <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> array with another manual array of countries that use &#8220;VAT.&#8221; This is used in the WooCommerce back end and front end to call taxes either VAT or TAX, based on the country code.</li><li><code>get_automated_support_countries()</code> merges the list of EU countries with &#8216;US\', &#8216;CA\', and &#8216;AU\' in order to return the list of countries that support automated tax calculations within WooCommerce.</li><li><code>get_note()</code> uses <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> to check if your store\'s country belongs to the EU. If it is and the WooCommerce AvaTax plugin is active, a banner ad is displayed to ask the store manager to install the EU VAT Number extension.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first looked into <code>get_european_union_countries()</code>, I was expecting it to be used more extensively within WooCommerce itself, but that\'s it. It\'s still useful for developers of course because we can come up with additional ways to use the function and save on development time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> for currency switching, to display conditional notices, content, or fields. Basically, whenever there is a country dropdown, <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> may be what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s analyze two more detailed scenarios for using this function.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Set Currency to EUR if the Order Billing Country is in the EU</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I issue a lot of manual orders on Business Bloomer, where my main currency is USD, like most of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that is a great currency to sell memberships, plugins, and online courses, EUR is the currency I actually use myself.  If I\'m on the receiving end of transactions form<strong> countries within the EU where EUR is the main currency</strong>, I pay lower fees, have greater trust, and my PayPal/Stripe accounts are filled with euros, so I pay no conversion fees. Naturally I want my customers to at least have the option to pay in EUR!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way I coded this is fairly simple — this is straight out of my own <code>functions.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * @snippet       Set new manual order currency | WooCommerce Admin\n * @how-to        Get CustomizeWoo.com FREE\n * @author        Rodolfo Melogli\n * @compatible    WooCommerce 6\n * @donate $9     https://businessbloomer.com/bloomer-armada/\n */\n \nadd_action( \'woocommerce_new_order\', \'bbloomer_update_order_currency_on_creation\', 9999, 2 );\n\nfunction bbloomer_update_order_currency_on_creation( $order_id, $order ){\n    if ( $order && $order-&gt;is_created_via( \'admin\' ) ) { \n		if ( get_post_meta( $order_id, \'_billing_country\', true ) && in_array( get_post_meta( $order_id, \'_billing_country\', true ), WC()-&gt;countries-&gt;get_european_union_countries( \'eu_vat\' ) ) ) {	\n			$order-&gt;set_currency( \'EUR\' );\n			$order-&gt;save();\n		}\n	}\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>W<strong>hat It Does:</strong> When I create and save a new order from the WooCommerce backend and the billing country belongs to the EU, the order currency is set to EUR by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another piece to this. If the order is manually set to the status of <em>pending</em> and the customer still needs to pay online, I also need to make EUR the default currency on the payment screen. Here\'s how I do that:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * @snippet       Set currency | WooCommerce Order Pay page\n * @how-to        Get CustomizeWoo.com FREE\n * @author        Rodolfo Melogli\n * @compatible    WooCommerce 6\n * @donate $9     https://businessbloomer.com/bloomer-armada/\n */\n \nadd_filter( \'woocommerce_currency\', \'bbloomer_switch_currency\' );\n\nfunction bbloomer_switch_currency( $currency ) {\n	if ( is_wc_endpoint_url( \'order-pay\' ) && in_array( WC()-&gt;customer-&gt;get_billing_country(), WC()-&gt;countries-&gt;get_european_union_countries( \'eu_vat\' ) ) ) {\n		return \'EUR\';\n	}\n	return $currency;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In this way I\'ve created a multi-currency setup <em>without any plugins!</em> Cool, ha?!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Show Conditional Content if the Order Billing Country is in the EU</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I use <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> in my PDF invoices as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>If the billing country is Italy, I need to show certain messages in Italian by law.</li><li>On the other hand, if the <strong>billing country belongs to the EU </strong>array, I need to display a notice called &#8220;Reverse Charge.&#8221; (This is for intra-EU transactions when the VAT is recorded by the buyer instead of the seller.)</li><li>Otherwise, the function will show a message for extra-EU transactions.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s my code:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * @snippet       Display VAT notices | WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing slips\n * @how-to        Get CustomizeWoo.com FREE\n * @author        Rodolfo Melogli\n * @compatible    WooCommerce 6\n * @donate $9     https://businessbloomer.com/bloomer-armada/\n */\n\nadd_action( \'wpo_wcpdf_after_order_details\', \'bbloomer_invoice_dpr_info\', 9999, 2 );\n\nfunction bbloomer_invoice_dpr_info( $template_type, $order ) {\n	if ( $order-&gt;get_billing_country() == \"IT\" ) {\n		?&gt;\n		&lt;?php if ( $order-&gt;get_total() &gt; 77.47 ) echo \'&lt;p&gt;(*) Imposta di bollo assolta ai sensi dell\\\'art. 13 della Tariffa allegata al DPR 26.10.72, n. 642&lt;/p&gt;\'; ?&gt;\n		&lt;p&gt;Operazione fuori campo IVA ai sensi dell\'art. 1, commi 54-89, L. 23/12/2014, n. 190&lt;/p&gt;\n		&lt;p&gt;Prestazione non soggetta a ritenuta d\'acconto ai sensi del comma 5.2 del Provvedimento Agenzia delle entrate del 22.12.2011 n. 185820&lt;/p&gt;		\n		&lt;?php\n	} elseif ( in_array( $order-&gt;get_billing_country(), WC()-&gt;countries-&gt;get_european_union_countries( \'eu_vat\' ) ) && ! empty( get_post_meta( $order-&gt;get_id(), \'_billing_vat_number_eu\', true ) ) ) {\n		// Intra EU Service\n		?&gt;\n		&lt;p&gt;Invoice subject to Reverse Charge rule in the country of receipt according to Italian law art. 7-TER, D.P.R. n. 633/1972&lt;/p&gt;	\n		&lt;?php\n	} else {\n		// Extra EU Service\n		// print_r($order);\n		?&gt;\n		&lt;?php /* if ( $order-&gt;get_total() &gt; 77.47 ) echo \'&lt;p&gt;(*) Cost of &euro;2 Italian stamp duty included in payment according to the Tariffa attachment, art. 13, DPR 26.10.72, n. 642&lt;/p&gt;\'; */ ?&gt;\n		&lt;p&gt;Invoice exempt from VAT/TAX according to Italian law art. 7, D.P.R. n. 633/1972&lt;/p&gt;		\n		&lt;?php\n	}\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever you have access to <code>$order-&gt;get_billing_country()</code>, you may use <code>get_european_union_countries()</code> for conditional content.

Even after tinkering with new features over the last few days, I have yet to explore everything as much as I would like. Given the practical limitation of time, I will not be able to dive into everything in this post, but I will attempt to introduce you all to some of the highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are some selected items that I was unable to dive into, but I still encourage readers to check out:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The selected <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39386\">color&#8217;s name now appears</a> in the color picker.</li><li>Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39209\">choose from a suggested list</a> of date formats or add a custom one for the Post Date block. These are internationalized, so the suggestions will be locale-specific.</li><li>Themes can add blocks to a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38806\">No Results container block</a> when a Query returns no posts.</li><li>The Tag Cloud block now has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37311\">minimum and maximum size controls</a>.</li><li>The Separator block <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38428\">supports the newer color control</a>, allowing users to select transparent colors.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Locking UI</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing a locked block.\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 12.9 introduces a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39183\">UI for locking blocks</a>. Under the &#8220;more options&#8221; dropdown in the toolbar, users can select the lock option, which will bring up a screen with two options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Disable movement:</strong> Disallows moving the block itself. However, sibling blocks can be moved around it.</li><li><strong>Prevent removal:</strong> Prevents the block from being deleted.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrei Draganescu noted the following in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/30/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12-9-30-march/\">12.9 announcement post</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When a block is locked, users are either unable to move it, remove it, or both. This is particularly useful with site level blocks like Post Content which many themes will want to lock down.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that definition does not entirely explain block-level locking. There is a caveat: this new UI hands end-users the key to the lock. Technically, they already had this capability via the code editor, but it is now available through the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a theme dev perspective, block-level locking merely requires additional steps of the user to move and/or remove blocks. It is not a &#8220;forced&#8221; or &#8220;permanent&#8221; lock. It is a welcome feature, but themers should understand its limits and that this new UI offers more power to users, not less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39566\">hook for site builders to overwrite this</a>.  See <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-9-adds-block-locking-ui-automatic-pattern-registration-and-full-theme-exports#comment-421351\">more in the comments</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Gap Support for Galleries…<em>Sort Of</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Block spacing for the Gallery block.\n\n\n\n<p>One of the features I was most excited about with this release was the addition of support for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38164\">spacing between Gallery images</a>. Theme authors have relied on specialized block styles to give users choices, usually limited to default and a &#8220;no gap&#8221; options. The latter would remove any spacing between the images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the feature is broken in 12.9 when users manually set a gap. Checking the source code, it is outputting an <code>Array</code> instead of valid CSS. On the front end, the following warning displays:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Warning: preg_match() expects parameter 2 to be string, array given in ...wp-content/plugins/gutenberg/build/block-library/blocks/gallery.php on line 51</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sure this will be corrected in 12.9.1. Until then, I suggest not using the &#8220;Block Spacing&#8221; control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Theme author warning:</strong> This is a breaking change for themes that target the <code>--gallery-block--gutter-size</code> to control the default gap for galleries. This previously-reliable CSS custom property no longer exists in the code. It is unclear why this variable was removed altogether, and there was no mention of it in the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new <code>--wp--style--unstable-gallery-gap</code> variable seems to do a similar job. However, as the <code>unstable</code> part of its name suggests, it may not always be around. It is also defined on the <code>.wp-container-*</code> class instead of the gallery itself. I have yet to do enough CSS testing to figure out how to overwrite it for the default gap. If anyone has a solution, please post it in the comments for others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Children Collapsed by Default in List View</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Opening a collapsed set of nested blocks in the list view.\n\n\n\n<p>I have often shied away from the list view in the editor for most real-world scenarios, at least for pages with many nested blocks. With every level open by default, it was a bit of a nightmare to browse through and locate a specific block. It was easier to take my chances clicking around in the content canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the latest Gutenberg release may just change my usage of it. Version 12.9 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39611\">collapses all child blocks by default</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Automatic Pattern Registration for Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can now let Gutenberg <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36751\">handle pattern registration for them</a>. They only need to follow a few rules:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add block patterns inside PHP files in a <code>/patterns</code> folder.</li><li>Add pattern data to the file header.</li><li>Add pattern content, of course.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Individual pattern files should look like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n/**\n * Title: A Pattern Title\n * Slug: namespace/slug\n * Description: A human-friendly description.\n * Viewport Width: 1024\n * Categories: comma, separated, values\n * Keywords: comma, separated, values\n * Block Types: comma, separated, values\n * Inserter: yes|no\n */\n ?&gt;\n &lt;!-- some-block-content /--&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Only the <code>Title</code> and <code>Slug</code> header fields are required. Each option matches a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_pattern/\"><code>register_block_pattern()</code> function argument</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors who want to use this feature now but provide backward compatibility with WordPress 5.9 can check for the existence of the <code>gutenberg_register_theme_block_patterns()</code> function. That is the function name for the moment, at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change further builds on top of the existing standards for block themes. Authors now have clear-cut guidelines on registering most features via standard files and folders:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>/parts</code> &#8211; Block template parts</li><li><code>/patterns</code> &#8211; Block patterns</li><li><code>/styles</code> &#8211; Global style variations</li><li><code>/templates</code> &#8211; Block templates</li><li><code>theme.json</code> &#8211; Global settings and styles</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from custom block styles and variations (not to be confused with global style variations), nearly everything is covered. This well-rounded set lowers the barrier to entry for future theme authors. Even seasoned developers should appreciate the simplicity of what to name things and where to put them. It is one less thing to worry about. It will also continue simplifying the WordPress.org theme review system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme Exporting and Template Building</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of lowering barriers, creators can now build an entire theme from the site editor. Well, assuming they start from an existing block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 12.9 introduces two vital features to the site-building process. The first allows users to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39202\">export a copy of their active theme</a> directly from the editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Exporting the active theme with customizations.\n\n\n\n<p>The downloaded ZIP file from this export is a fully-functioning theme. It includes all user customizations alongside every file that already exists in the original.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a few things that are not yet possible from the editor, and these will need to be manually adjusted before public release. The theme name and other data in <code>style.css</code> will remain the same as the original theme. There is also no method for snagging a screenshot of the customized version and bundling it in the ZIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a leap forward for democratizing design, but other flows will need to be considered. Users should be able to export as a child theme with only their customizations or even as a <code>*.json</code> file (global style variation).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, there is a more immediate and practical use case. Users can download their customized themes and upload them to another site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second crucial update for development within the site editor is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39353\">support for more templates</a>. Users can now create the following from the templates management panel in addition to the existing ones;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Author</li><li>Category</li><li>Date</li><li>Tag</li><li>Taxonomy</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a new Author template.\n\n\n\n<p>The new templates are welcome additions, but the template-creation feature still has limits. There is no way to create variations on those templates via the UI, such as <code>category-wordpress</code>, <code>taxonomy-genre</code>, or the dozens of other possibilities. However, it will happen one day.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 03:38:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 52) — Improving Your Live Video Self\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=94877\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-excerpt-no-52-improving-your-live-video-self/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5127:\"<h2 id=\"more-important-than-being-responsive-is-setting-expectations-dave-rodenbaugh\">“Embrace Progress Over Perfection” — Roshanda Pratt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, David meets <strong>Roshanda Pratt</strong> and welcomes her to the WordPress community.

Plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\">CoBlocks</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/kadence-blocks/\">Kadence Blocks</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-addons-for-gutenberg/\">Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg</a> offer dozens of blocks in one package, focusing mostly on blocks not offered in core. WordPress.org&#8217;s Block Directory gave some incentive for creating single-block plugins, allowing users to search for and install them inside the block editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/a-new-era/\">block themes generally include less custom CSS than traditional themes</a>, some plugin developers are experimenting with applying interesting styles to WordPress&#8217; core blocks. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/snow-monkey-editor/\">Snow Monkey Editor</a>, created by developer Takashi Kitajima, is one such plugin that doesn&#8217;t include any custom blocks. Instead, it extends the block editor to give unique styles to core blocks, giving them the appearance of custom blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Snow Monkey Editor will take a simple paragraph and transform it into various alert styles, post-it, speech, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to paragraphs, the plugin has extra styles for image blocks, including different fluid shapes and shadowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The List block also includes several different pre-set styles to make lists more interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin puts a monkey icon inside the block toolbar that offers more formatting options for text, including background color, badge, font size, highlighter, letter spacing, line height, and text color.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Snow Monkey Editor also includes some utility and display settings for all blocks, including the following:  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hide on smartphone size or tablet size or PC size. (Using media query)</li><li>Hide by user roles. (Using <code>render_block</code> filter hook. If it does not pass this filter, it is ignored)</li><li>Scroll animation</li><li>Publish date time settings</li><li>Unpublish date time settings</li><li>Edit lock by user roles. (Only administrators can set it)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These settings essentially allow editors to do things like disappear selected blocks on a set date, hide content depending on device display size, and lock content from being edited by different user roles. Some of these could be helpful when building websites for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collection of styles for different blocks reminds me of the old days before the block editor when users would create similar formatted text using shortcodes. This new block-based approach is far less clunky and allows users to quickly preview the styles as they are working in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/snow-monkey-editor/\">Snow Monkey Editor</a> plugin is available on WordPress.org, and has more than 10,000 active installs. It can be used with any theme, as the styles are mostly subtle and harmonious. If the plugin is deactivated, the block styles revert to the default core styles. Takashi Kitajima has also created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/snow-monkey-blocks/\">Snow Monkey Blocks</a> plugin with ~3 dozen custom blocks, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/snow-monkey-forms/\">Snow Monkey Forms</a> plugin with 13 blocks, and a <a href=\"https://snow-monkey.2inc.org/\">Snow Monkey theme</a> for those who want more complimentary extensions designed to work with Snow Monkey Editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 22:32:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Post Status: This Week at WordPress.org (March 28, 2022)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95192\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/this-week-at-wordpress-org-march-28-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9619:\"<p>Each week we are highlighting the news from WordPress.org that you don\'t want to miss.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the security of WordPress. If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WP Tavern dot com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you and hopefully get you or your idea on the show. Head over to WP Tavern dot com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Oliver Sild. Oliver has been working in the WordPress space for many years, and specifically with WordPress security, as one of the founders of Patchstack, formerly called WebARX. Patchstack is a product which is designed to help you identify plugin vulnerabilities in your WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of years, Patchstack has released an annual report about the state of WordPress security. The report for 2021 has just been released, and the podcast today is concerned with what they found out. We talk about why they produce this report. Who the intended audience is. What are the main takeaways in terms of the overall security of WordPress Core plugins and themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then get into more specific details about what types of vulnerabilities and attacks seem to be prevalent in the WordPress space. Are there any trends which are useful to think about, and how WordPress security is managed by the community as a whole. Are budgets and time typically allocated for prevention and restoration of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end we talk about how some people have pushed back on the usefulness of the report. They&#8217;ve questioned the motivations of security companies to write such reports and the use of language which they contain. Do they paint a more negative picture in order to drive sales of their commercial solutions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links and the show notes by heading over to. WP Tavern dot com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes. And so without further delay, I bring you all Oliver Sild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Oliver Sild. Hello Oliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:16] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Hello Nathan, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m very well, thank you for joining us today. Oliver Sild will no doubt be able to introduce himself, but I&#8217;ll just do a very quick job. Oliver is, I believe, one of the founders, if not the founder of Patchstack, formerly WebARX, which is a security solution for WordPress websites amongst other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my first question to you all about, just give us a little bit of background, certainly more than I just provided. Tell us about your history with WordPress and how you came to be involved with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:47] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah. So in 20, 20 13, 20 14, around that time I was actually running a web development company we were mostly back then building websites in Joomla and then I remember just at one point, the demand on the market changed pretty much everyone wanted to WordPress site. So that kind of naturally moved us from Joomla to WordPress, and because our company was, we were calling our services like a secure web development. So what we wanted to do is that if we are building you something we&#8217;ll also make sure that the security side of that is covered as well. So we already had some level of internal tools built which were helping us to track what kind of software we were using on our different kind of customer&#8217;s websites. And that eventually, well, by now has turned into what Patchstack is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much, indeed. So security is your thing. And very recently there was a piece on the WP Tavern website, which I will link to a little bit later, which was highlighting the fact that you had released one of your annual reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe we&#8217;re on possibly the second iteration now. It&#8217;s called the state of WordPress security. And in this case it was 2021. So it&#8217;s a look back over the last year in WordPress security. And we&#8217;ll go into that. And that really is the point of the podcast today. We&#8217;re just going to appraise all of the different bits and pieces that you highlighted there because I&#8217;m imagining that most people listening to this podcast are deeply into WordPress. And this is obviously a seriously important side of any WordPress website, keeping it updated and secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then towards the end of the podcast, we&#8217;ll go into a little bit of an exchange that happened over on a website where somebody called into question the language that you&#8217;re using over here, but, okay, so first thing I&#8217;m going to suggest then is that if you&#8217;re listening to this, you may like to go to Patchstack dot com forward slash white paper forward slash the state of WordPress security in 2021. All of those words are separated by hyphens. And you&#8217;re going to find the article that we&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s broken up into lots of different sections. But first question is why are you making the efforts to write this report? And we know that you have a WordPress security company. That is your job. That&#8217;s what you do, but why go to the lengths of illustrating what&#8217;s going on in the WordPress space so that people like me, the general public can consume it? It must require quite a lot of resources and effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:14] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Indeed yeah. I think we put that report together for three months. So it&#8217;s quite in depth by the way. If you want to quickly open up the white paper, you can just go to Patchstack dot com, we have with the banner on our front page that&#8217;s actually linking to that, but that&#8217;s a side note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We actually did that first, last year. So we last year released one about the previous year and we started doing that on the point where as a company, we decided to switch into a very specific focus on security vulnerabilities found in the software that is built for and around the WordPress ecosystem, which is the WordPress Core, the plugins and themes and the wordpress.org repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also the WordPress plugins and themes that are built as a premium ones that are not in the WordPress repository or the ones that are actually built or like being provided, some other marketplaces like Envato and so on. And by doing that, we switch the, like we have a SaaS product that is providing, we have a free version of a SaaS product where you can like, just connect like 99 websites, for example, and have a central overview if any of the plugins on any of your websites is becoming vulnerable. And at the same time, we started, looking into those different kinds of popular plugins and if they are vulnerable or not, then for years we&#8217;ve been providing code review and security auditing services for plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing that over the time, what we&#8217;ve collected together is like a quite big database, so security issues around the WordPress ecosystem. So if you go to Patchstack dot com slash database, you actually see a full-blown list of all of the security vulnerabilities that are in the plugins, themes, WordPress Core, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last year, what we did is that we figured, we understood already by doing surveys and so on that actually plugin vulnerabilities and theme vulnerabilities, and like anything that you are running on your website that becomes vulnerable, is pretty much the number one security threat to the website. And then we started a thing that we call it today Patchstack Alliance, where we just decided to start building a community of ethical hackers, who then submit vulnerabilities that they find in any WordPress plugins in the ecosystem to us. We make sure that we help the plugin developer to fix those issues. And then we actually pay to those ethical hackers for the contribution that they make to the WordPress security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s on the other hand, generates a lot of data for us. So a lot of data about new vulnerabilities. A lot of data about, what is actually happening in that ecosystem. And we just decided to pull all that information and data that we have collected over this time and make it into a kind of annual report or a white paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s really definitely worth having a look at, because it portrays, obviously now that you&#8217;re in the second iteration of this, you&#8217;re able to compare the way that things were last year. And in many ways, this is a comparison piece based upon last year. And so we often hear the phrases, such and such a thing is up such and such a thing as down, you&#8217;re looking for trends basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main gist is three sections. As you described, we&#8217;re talking about WordPress Core, WordPress themes and finally WordPress plugins. There&#8217;s obviously a little bit of nuance in there. Do you want to illustrate for us what you&#8217;ve found to be the big highlight bullet items, if you&#8217;d like for those three areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So should we start with Core? Let&#8217;s discuss what it is that you found over the last year in terms of the security or otherwise of WordPress Core. To paraphrase, it seems pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:02] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah. Like WordPress has quite mature software development cycle. WordPress the core, also has the bug bounty program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have the bounty program on hacker one. And who doesn&#8217;t know what backcountry program is? It&#8217;s basically, like you say to hackers, come hack my software. If you find something report it directly to me so I can fix it, then they will pay to you. So this is the approach that is being, is becoming very popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the same thing, what we do to plugins, but WordPress has its for it&#8217;s own core. So they do that, which is nice because that is actually getting much more security attention on the WordPress Core. And at the same time we see less major security vulnerabilities being discovered in the Core itself. And something that we also saw this year, which was a little bit different was the dependency confusion attacks, where there was like a high risk of being maybe like a custom plugin being updated from the wrong source. I think the Core had an interesting year, but what we see is in general that the Core has a matured development kind of processes and cycle in place. So it&#8217;s getting better each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think in the year 2017, I believe it was, the bug bounty program began with hacker one and it would appear, it seems to have worked because over the years after that, there&#8217;s been a fairly precipitous drop in the amount of concern with WordPress Core. In fact of the four security updates that were released in 2021. And again, we&#8217;re talking about Core it would appear that only one of them had a critical vulnerability, which wasn&#8217;t actually concerning something that was Core. It was an insecure component. It was PHP mailer library if I remember rightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that points to the idea that anybody these days is saying that WordPress itself is an insecure platform, which I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all encountered when we&#8217;ve been building client websites and so on, people have this fear that WordPress itself is pretty insecure and your document seems to imply exactly the opposite. It&#8217;s very robust and very secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, and if you read our white paper, we actually say that, we are saying that WordPress has done a very good job at that. WordPress is getting more and more security attention, obviously, as it&#8217;s running, soon, almost like the half of web, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense that it gets more attention. More attention means more stuff is being found, more stuff being found means more stuff is fixed. And this is a good thing. And in terms of like the whole mature way of how there&#8217;s regular security updates and regular updates for the core itself. It shows that the core is doing really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you want to illustrate for those people who perhaps aren&#8217;t familiar, one of the headline paragraphs that you&#8217;ve got right near the top is, the dependency confusion attacks. Now this may be something that people are very familiar with. I suspect maybe not. Do you just want to outline what those are and why you&#8217;ve illustrated it in the report this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:09] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, we call it the fear of dependency confusion attacks, because we didn&#8217;t really see any dependency confusion attacks specifically. Like I was mentioning before, there was a risk where if you have a custom plugin that is not on the wordpress.org repo. And if you are adding a new plugin to the repo with the same slug that this custom plugin was using, then you could pretty much overwrite the custom plugin on the websites that it was running at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this was like, a risk where if there is like a plugin made by someone, maybe installed on like very high profile websites. This plugin is not known to the WP dot org, or it is not on the WordPress dot org repo, but someone made a plugin for, with the same slug and it went past it. And then the auto-update mechanism in the WordPress Core would basically update this plugin, now, which was a core, which was a custom plugin into the plugin that is now in the WordPress repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basically replacing someone else&#8217;s plugin with a plugin made by another author. The content can be checked by the wordpress.org, like what actually this new plugin would do. But at the same time, of course a bit of a fear, I think a lot of people were afraid that this is going to affect everyone, but it was more of a theoretical thing that was a risk, but we didn&#8217;t really see any of such effects happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah in software, in general, nothing to do with WordPress, this kind of supply chain attack is potentially a real problem, isn&#8217;t it? Because if you can somehow become the official canonical source of the software, even though you are not the official canonical source of the software, you could in theory, get to many, many places very, very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And and it&#8217;s nice to see that you&#8217;ve not really found too much evidence of that over the last year. So WordPress core itself, I think it&#8217;s fair to say, you feel is in very good shape. The problem is really for WordPress and I&#8217;m sure this is something that many people can relate to if they&#8217;ve been using the software for any length of time, we&#8217;re going to get into themes and plugins. This is where I guess the problems begin to arise. Let&#8217;s tackle them in turn. Let&#8217;s go for themes first. What were the broad sweeping outlines that you that you discovered in your exploration of themes this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:32] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> I think this has been happening over the time, but basically what we see is that the line between themes and plugins is getting blurrier and blurrier Themes now use a lot of PHP code for, site builders are also, people considered as themes in a way, but then at the same time they actually a plugin. Yeah, so the line is getting blurrier and more PHP code is being introduced into the functionality of the themes, which basically brings the same kind of threats to the themes that we have with plugins, where there can be a kind of vulnerable PHP code that can be a trick doing something that was not meant to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what you saw is that there are vulnerabilities within themes that are as critical as you could expect from the plugins. It isn&#8217;t from this report, but I think a good example is. It was just recently with Freemius library, which was used by a lot of themes. And this is like exactly the supply chain issue where, there&#8217;s thousands of websites that are using one theme, and if this one theme becomes vulnerable, then all these thousands of websites are vulnerable. But now we&#8217;re also seeing where there&#8217;s thousands of themes on these themes use a library, and if this library gets vulnerable, then all these thousands of themes become vulnerable. And all those, I don&#8217;t know, hundreds of thousands of websites that use these thousands of themes become vulnerable as well. So this, you can see how this is coming, like from top to the bottom and eventually affecting a lot of websites. So as an example, I think two or three weeks ago when the Freemius thing happened, I think we, I believe we added 1,800 different vulnerabilities or vulnerable components to the Patchstack database in a single day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next year is going to be definitely more, we have more data that&#8217;s definitely from this year about theme vulnerabilities than we have from the past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There were a fair number of what you might describe as critical vulnerabilities. There&#8217;s a list that you&#8217;ve described, depending on how interested you are in security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The names of these things may be of interest or otherwise, but things like unauthenticated, arbitrary file upload and option deletion, that would appear to have been found at least in your case, 10 times in 10 different themes. Unauthenticated upload vulnerability, leading to remote code execution, which you&#8217;ve found in one theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arbitrary file upload vulnerability, 42 themes were affected. So it&#8217;s fairly widespread. And I guess if any of those themes are incredibly popular, that can quickly get out of hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:16] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Absolutely. If a single plugin that has, especially those unauthenticated vulnerabilities are the scariest ones because they require no access to the website, like any permissions to your websites and someone could basically, the malicious hacker could potentially upload file to your site without gaining access to the website. So this kind of vulnerabilities are very scary as they can be abused automatically and on scale. So indeed, like if a single plugin would have a hundred thousand installations and it would have just one, this one vulnerability, especially for unauthenticated one, then what we are seeing is that hackers very quickly build custom tools to start finding all the websites on the internet that use that theme and then start exploiting them automatically to inject backdoors or redirect traffic from the website, change the search engine results for your website. So if you watch, if you look at the website everything seems to be okay. But if you Google your website, for example, then it would give completely different results and redirect your site to somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, is the trend in terms of themes, is your experience that there was more concern over the last year than there was in the previous 12 months? Or is it essentially the same quantity of vulnerabilities?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:39] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> I guess the trend is the fact that the vulnerabilities are just becoming a little bit more critical. I wouldn&#8217;t say that there is a big trend in terms of that there is like a massive increase in the vulnerabilities in themes, but I think the fact that so much more functionality is being shipped with the themes in terms of the PHP code in general than they are just more and more prone to being introduced or introducing that kind of critical vulnerabilities into the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Let&#8217;s move on to WordPress plugins and this, as one might expect, has possibly greater numbers attached to it. There&#8217;s more plugins out there, and I would imagine that most websites have got one, possibly two themes, whereas they might have 15, 18 20, whatever the average number now is plugins. So there&#8217;s probably a bit of a larger target painted on plugins back than there is on themes back. Give us the overarching findings in terms of WordPress plugins for 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:40] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah. Plugins are the ones that we&#8217;ve been focusing the most on. And these are the ones that our Alliance members or like the community of the ethical hackers that are reporting new vulnerabilities to us. Majority of the vulnerabilities that are being reported to us are about the plugins. If we&#8217;re looking about the total number of new vulnerabilities that we&#8217;ve added to the database of vulnerabilities that effect the WordPress Core, plugins and themes, then there has been quite heavy increase in if we compare it to the last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that means that is actually very good news because that means that these are vulnerabilities that the developer has been able to get fixed because these vulnerabilities didn&#8217;t appear this year. These vulnerabilities probably in many cases at least they were sitting in those plugins for quite some time already. What just happened, why there is an increase in new identified vulnerabilities is just the fact that there&#8217;s more people looking at those, and reporting them to the developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There was a couple of plugins, and I guess this is the difference with plugins is that really the sky is the limit in terms of the numbers of installs. I don&#8217;t know what the largest install base of any particular theme is, but I&#8217;m guessing it is nowhere near the install base of the largest WordPress plugins. And so there was a couple that you mentioned in one case, one of the plugins that had a critical vulnerability this year was over 3 million website installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there was another one with over a million. The seriousness of that is pretty obvious I&#8217;m sure. The quantity of people that are affected. You seem to be saying that in terms of the conscientiousness of the developers, you seem to be fairly happy with that, in that a lot of vulnerabilities got patched fairly quickly and disclosed in the appropriate way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we&#8217;ve still got this legacy of older plugins. In fact, you mentioned nine that have been removed from the repository, completely gone from the repository and yet have vulnerabilities, which essentially are going to stick around for ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:56] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, these are the most scariest ones. Like in, in most cases what we see is that developers, once a security report is being delivered to them, they look into it and they release a patch. So they fix it in most cases, the vulnerability doesn&#8217;t become publicly disclosed before that happens. Like, we also have our own disclosure policy where we just don&#8217;t like, we let the developer know about the vulnerability that was reported to us about, his, or her plugin, but at the same time, we keep it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t publish that before we make sure that the developer had enough time to fix that. And also after that, that they have time to let their own users know that there is a security update and they should basically, update the sites as fast as possible. Just to make sure that we don&#8217;t cause any unwanted damage where this information might get in front of the wrong person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we, what we wanted to do this year is we counted all the critical vulnerabilities and by critical, we mean the ones that are actually being, are actually the vulnerabilities that have the characteristics that hackers would want to automate exploitation attempts. So that means that it&#8217;s usually unauthenticated vulnerability, that basically you can either inject something to the website, add a back door or something, and you can fully automate that. And there was, yeah, like I think we counted, I think it was 35 different plugins that had that kind of vulnerabilities in last year. The scary part was that many of them didn&#8217;t really receive a fix at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these are plugins where the developer was either, had abandoned the plugin, was not active anymore. So in that sense, if you were running this plugin for example, if you were part of those plugins that didn&#8217;t ever receive a patch for this critical vulnerability. In your WordPress website, you would just see that everything is up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You would never see that there is an issue with this plugin unless you are being notified by like some security product or something that would say that, Hey, there is a vulnerability in this plugin. So this is a bit scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. This, I think we should dwell on this actually, because it seems like this is a real failing, or at least an area of possible improvement in the future. So let&#8217;s just reiterate what we&#8217;ve just said. So we&#8217;ve got a plugin, which has discontinued support. There are no ongoing updates for whatever reason, this plugin, which is in the repository is stalled. Nobody&#8217;s going to update it in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, at some point in the future, a vulnerability is discovered in it. It could be severe, it could be minor. It doesn&#8217;t really matter, but the point being that any WordPress user would never be alerted to the fact that something here is awry and something needs updating, because the only mechanism we&#8217;ve got in the WordPress admin area is to see when things need updating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we update them. And if there&#8217;s no update, the assumption would be everything must be fine. How on earth do we overcome this problem in the future? Do you have any thoughts on a process that we could adopt or some direction of travel that we might move in to make this go away?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:15] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Oh yeah, it requires a lot of awareness building around the ecosystem in general. We need to talk even more about the security in the WordPress ecosystem. We need to make sure that developers are also the ones that are not afraid to talk about security, because over the years, what we&#8217;ve seen is a lot of developers, like the plugin developers, specifically have been worried about like even dealing with security issues because they don&#8217;t want to be highlighted as, oh, this plugin had the vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they see this as a negative kind of attention. In fact, for me, for example, completely from the opposite side see it as a very good sign that this developer actually takes attention on security. But that&#8217;s obviously because, from my end, I just see that there are so many vulnerabilities in different plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the fact that there&#8217;s just increasing numbers of them now being reported from the last year, in our white paper, for example, that just the fact that more of them are being identified and being reacted on. It&#8217;s not the fact that there&#8217;s now, more of them, but they are at the same time what they see constantly is that the developers don&#8217;t need to be afraid of the security issues in a sense where they try to avoid those issues. And I think there should be even more and more open discussion about, hey, let&#8217;s together make the security in the plugins and in the software better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess in terms of the core, I guess at one point core would need to have some level of security incorporated to basically give an insight on the plugins that are being used on the websites. For that specific reason, for example, because there&#8217;s been so much people saying, even from people that worked in the wordpress.org, we&#8217;ve seen people saying that, yeah, basically you just need to enable auto updates and you would be fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s just not true because in many cases like that, you can have auto updates enabled, but this there&#8217;s no update, if there is no update for the plugin, basically you don&#8217;t even know about issue. So I guess, yeah, this is definitely something that needs attention over the years. We are doing our best, like our product is actually literally covering that area of letting the users know if there&#8217;s a vulnerability, even if this plugin is being removed from the repo, or even if this plugin didn&#8217;t even receive a patch. So we are letting our customer know about that. Then we are also providing a patch to protect against the attacks against these plugins. But at the same time, yeah, I think this is clearly a issue that needs more and more attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it would be nice to come up with some kind of system which didn&#8217;t break things, which enabled, I don&#8217;t know, perhaps these particular plugins to be disabled. In some way removed, but then that of course has all sorts of implications in terms of the ownership of the site and whether you actually want people to have the capacity to be able to remove things from your website. People flock to WordPress because you get to own everything. It&#8217;s yours, and you can modify it as you like. And the idea that some plugin could be removed, disabled without your say so, is one that I&#8217;m sure the community would definitely want to have a long and deep conversation about. But interesting. You found nine that had these problems this year and there seemingly is no way of automating that problem to go away, as yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;ve dealt with core, we&#8217;ve dealt with themes and plugins and what I&#8217;ve just described as orphaned plugins. Let&#8217;s just talk about the broad bits and pieces that your report highlighted this year. Some of it is good. Some of it is less good, but the first sort of headline pieces that you&#8217;ve definitely found that there was a rise in vulnerabilities found compared to 2022. On the face of it that sounds like a bad thing, but you&#8217;re saying that there were many more in the previous year than in the year prior to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:24] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s the best news of the white paper, to be honest, because that means that there was 150% more vulnerabilities being identified. Imagine if there was zero vulnerabilities being identified and only, and all those vulnerabilities would be sitting there, still doing that, and just nobody would know about those, until someone who with malicious intention could just take advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this year we are going to see even a bigger increase because there&#8217;s just so much more attention being put into identifying those vulnerabilities and helping the plugin developers to make their code even more secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are for sure investing a lot into it with Patchstack Alliance. Like last year we paid out like 13 K in the bounties for like individual ethical hackers who just let us know about vulnerabilities that they found in any plugins in the WordPress ecosystem, and we just paid them for that effort. So we&#8217;re definitely going to double down this year on that as well. So we&#8217;ll see how that will affect this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting because on the face of it, if the number of vulnerabilities is larger, the immediate instinct around that is to assume that things have got worse. And of course the statistics could be for all sorts of reasons. As you&#8217;ve just described, there&#8217;s perhaps more eyeballs looking to discover these things. There&#8217;s initiatives like your own and the bug bounty, which have enabled people to actually feel that they&#8217;re getting remunerated for that. And so they&#8217;re more serious in the endeavor to search for them. But also, maybe it&#8217;s a product of the fact that WordPress itself is just growing, and as it grows, there&#8217;s going to be more eyeballs looking for these things, but also possibly it becomes a bigger target. And so there are more of these things out there. There&#8217;s more plugins, there&#8217;s more themes, there&#8217;s more code and it&#8217;s just a sort of byproduct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, interesting take on it. Definitely worth looking at. That was the rise in vulnerabilities now onto more sort of specific details about what these types of vulnerabilities are. A significant proportion of the things that you concerned yourself this year with were XSS vulnerabilities, which is cross site scripting. For those people who are not really familiar with that, would you just paint a picture of what cross site scripting vulnerabilities are, and any thoughts on why it represents almost 50% of everything that you&#8217;re seeing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> I think cross site scripting is just one of the easiest things to find the web. See, cross-site scripting, for example, you take like a website search bar, if you go to a WordPress site and there&#8217;s like a search bar. And if you, for example, write inside of this search bar, like HTML code, for example, and then what happens is that this, the functionality that is searching this information from the site for example, is going to show you the results, and this HTML code that you put there would then basically be meshed together with the kind of code of the website and it would just basically load it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think actually even a better example would be with comments. Wherever you have, like WordPress don&#8217;t have that issue, but for example, or earlier days, there was a lot of websites with commenting sections. And then if there was an issue where if you basically post any HTML code with some, maybe Java script, something that was maybe popping up like an alert for you and you post that comment there, then what would happen is that the site would then basically render that into as part of the code of the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it was even saved in that case, then the siet would basically load the code that was posted there as actual comment. So this is like a sanitation thing as well. So you want to make sure that you make a difference between actual code and what the content is that is being submitted to the website or the input in that sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it represents almost the majority, 49.8 something percent of everything that you find. But I guess that is as you describe, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s relatively straightforward to pull off. Possibly at least from my perspective, the vulnerabilities then shrink in terms of percentage and towards the very bottom, I guess the worst really that you could have is remote code execution. And that number is not 0.94% of everything that you were looking at. So I guess there&#8217;s some positive message to come out with that. Less than 1% of all the things were truly very serious indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, indeed. As always easiest stuff comes out the first. So these are the ones that are usually reported the most, that are mostly visible and accessible in terms of, for even a simple thing can just submit something into a comment form, and see if it&#8217;s going to load something in a weird way. So this kind of vulnerability is going to be found very easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Now moving on to plugins. Curious thing that you&#8217;ve discovered again from the data that you&#8217;ve managed to gather is that there are actually fewer plugins in use, which, you would imagine, would reduce the attack surface. And so you would equally think that the number of things that you were having to clean up regularly or that you were discovering had been broken, would go down. But it seems that there&#8217;s a sting in the tail. So there&#8217;s fewer plugins, but more of them are being left without being updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:56] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Indeed. Yeah. This was an interesting find. I expect that, I do still expect that the number of plugins, we&#8217;re going to see this number dropping more and more, even in the upcoming years, as people are getting more and more aware around the security implications when you&#8217;re just, using a lot of plugins on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think it&#8217;s also about the kind of hygiene thing where users are also not so prone anymore to leave like deactivated plugins standing there on the website. So they&#8217;re starting to delete those things. And I think people are seeing more and more that plugins, like each of the plugin that you install to your website can be like a link, can be like an entry point for a hacker if there is a vulnerability found in that specific plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basically the less buttons you have, you reduce the risk significantly. So it was interesting yes, to see that even though the number of plugins installed per website is actually dropping. But at the same time, the amount of plugins out of those that were outdated was actually higher. I&#8217;m not a hundred percent sure that what is like the actual cause of that, or if it&#8217;s just like something that we see this year, but I think next year we&#8217;re going to have more data to see more into why that could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s curious on the 50,000 websites that you were analyzing in order to generate this report down from 23 plugins and themes, now residing at about 18. 18 different plugins and themes installed. Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. We&#8217;ll revisit that next year and see where we&#8217;re at. I guess this is a fairly obvious thing to say, but it was worth pointing out, the seventh point on your list of things was that the easy to exploit vulnerabilities remain the main targets, like I said, that&#8217;s fairly straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:52] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Anything that is unauthenticated and basically that can be automated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s old tried and tested things that the hackers know can be achieved. They&#8217;re going to go after the low hanging fruit. And sadly, the eight point that you make is that old vulnerabilities remain as great big targets. So things which could have been fixed from last year, still are hanging out there and being exploited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:19] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, indeed. I think a big reason for that, there are all these automated hacking tools. I mean that people don&#8217;t load from Github or from hacking forums and places like that, where guys who, you know, sometimes kids who get into, like looking into hacking, trying to maybe yeah getting into that field. They are basically downloading software that is prebuilt by someone and there&#8217;s someone made it at the point where there was specific vulnerabilities just introduced. So they have hard-coded the exploitations into those tools and these tools are still available, and people who are getting into the kind of dark side, I&#8217;d say, are then starting to play with those tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is one of the reasons why we see that happening. We&#8217;ve seen a few of those tools as well. This kind of proves the point. But then in terms of that, like there isn&#8217;t a lot of hits that these tools are probably getting, because most of those websites that running those plugins have already been either patched or either hacked already and then patched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. An interesting thing that comes up later is really around the personnel who are responsible for updating things. And you&#8217;ve got a couple of points on this, but we&#8217;ll try to tackle them in one go. Whilst there&#8217;s an increase in awareness of security on WordPress websites, no doubt because of publications such as your own, it would appear that there&#8217;s not a lot of time, space, money provided. So who is responsible for updating things could be really crucial. And it says on your report that 53% of respondents stated that they updated their components weekly. Some, perhaps as many as 20% did things daily. 18% possibly monthly updates happening. So that&#8217;s quite an important blend in the picture. That the frequency of updates, crucial I suppose. If you&#8217;re leaving things for an entire month and a not keeping yourself up to date with the news, I&#8217;m sure that there&#8217;s many websites where monthly is just off the charts. It would probably be more like every six months or possibly not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also, the difficulty in actually finding a budget to do these things. And you make the point that many, many websites be they run by an agency or an individual, or just a solopreneur. They have no budget for this kind of thing. They&#8217;re just crossing their fingers and hoping for the best. So do you want to talk around that? The people involved, the time that they&#8217;ve got, the frequency of updates and the budget that they&#8217;ve got?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:59] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah. The frequency is an interesting take because in terms of how fast we are often seeing attacks happen against websites when a new vulnerability, or let&#8217;s say a critical vulnerability is being found in a plugin that the website is using. These like when we are not even talking about zero days in this case. Zero days are the ones that nobody knows the vulnerability before it&#8217;s already being attacked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for example, sometimes the vulnerability is being discovered, disclosed. And after that, hackers learn about that and then they are going to basically exploit that. So there&#8217;s like a cat and mouse game. Who patches first? Is it the hacker or, sorry, who uses the vulnerability first? Is it like the website owner who was going to update this and patches it, or is it the hacker who manages to exploit this before to website owner managers to update it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this time period is actually somewhere around one hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:54] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah. So this is something that has to be kept in mind that, daily updates sounds good as well. And from there on, the longer time to take for updating, the more risk there is for the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the interesting thing is like the auto updates. Have you put like WordPress autoupdate into Google search and look that into what kind of articles are popping up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, but I can imagine you&#8217;ve got some interesting insights there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:25] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Basically the majority of the articles are about how to turn off WordPress auto updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:33] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> I remember when WordPress auto updates came for the plugins, and basically like most of the kinds of articles or like how-to&#8217;s use we&#8217;re about to come to turn it off. Because people are still scared the websites are going to break down if there&#8217;s some feature breaking update coming for a plugin. So this is something interesting about the updating side of things that we&#8217;ve been seeing over the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s a really interesting, difficult seesaw to think about. The idea of being, if you switch off auto updates, which of course is available for multitude of things in WordPress, including plugins, you can just have click a button next to the plugin and it will just automatically update it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people concerned that the update might break the site. So in terms of them having to do some additional work to un-break it, or re-install from a backup or whatever it is that they need to do. That concern in many cases overrides the possibility that there could be some vulnerable software there, a plugin, which is vulnerable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess it&#8217;s a difficult one to decide which way to go. But it&#8217;s curious that a lot of people have decided to not implement automatic updates because presumably of the fear of things going astray in the way it looks or a plugin breaking. And of course that is a legitimate concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just seen over the last week that a couple of major plugins had problems where they broke significant parts of the websites, and they had to roll back those updates and then ultimately figure out a patch and then release that as the new update, which then got automatically updated. So I can see where people&#8217;s concerns come from there. I guess your advice would be switch on automatic updates because having a hacked website is probably better than having a modestly broken website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:23] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah. And actually the other way around. I heard you were saying that the hacked website is better than broken website. So I was saying the other way around, so it&#8217;s better to have a broken website than a hacked website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s what I intended to say if I got that wrong. I apologize. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:40] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> But yeah, basically, yeah, it&#8217;s better to have a broken website because you can at least put the maintenance mode on and do something about that and fix it. And usually like how WordPress is behaving right now is that it also lets you know if something was breaking down and it doesn&#8217;t like, the site doesn&#8217;t throw you a bunch of errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn&#8217;t like that anymore. So it isn&#8217;t that much of a risk at that point anymore to be completely afraid of plugin auto updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yes. Then that&#8217;s a good point. And you will also hopefully receive an email with some kind of information about the problem that may have brought your site down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Turning then to the budget. This is really interesting, the data that you&#8217;ve gathered, as much as 28% of people who responded said that they basically had zero budget to protect their websites. In other words, 28% of those people were just hoping for the best and crossing their fingers. And a further 27% said that they had a monthly budget of between $1 and $3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The numbers vary. There are people who had significantly more and people who were somewhere in between, but quite an interesting spread there from zero to quite a lot. And the majority of these numbers are tending towards a very small budget I guess that you would argue that, it ultimately, it would be better to have something than nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:01] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> For sure. Yeah. I guess the zero budget also means free plugins right? In a way of using like free security plugins and then it doesn&#8217;t mean a hundred percent that don&#8217;t use anything or they don&#8217;t have any measures in place. But at the same time, what we are also seeing is that security is still a hard sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially when we talk to agencies where the customers are like, aren&#8217;t you supposed to take care of it? Not understanding that the security is a thing that needs to be taken care of separately. That is a part of ongoing process and that you should basically prevent them rather than just deal with the consequences later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was another good point where we also asked from the same people about how much they have paid for malware cleanups within the past year. And that was like, there was one, I think the highest responder was like, who said he spent 4.8 K dollars on cleanups last year. That&#8217;s a lot of websites that you can secure or protect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And basically we even get some sort of service on top of it, or like incident response assistance that like we offer where, specialists are jumping in and fixing everything if something should happen, even though we had security in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now, obviously you&#8217;re here representing Patchstack, and Patchstack is a commercial company. You&#8217;re in the business of securing websites, but you&#8217;re also in the business of paying your employees. So you need to pay to use the service. There was an interesting piece which got written over on the Master WP website, and I will make sure to link to it in the show notes. And there&#8217;s a further piece which we&#8217;ll get to in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was written by Rob Howard on March the 14th and it was called, is WordPress security getting better or worse. In this piece, he takes your report to task and largely it&#8217;s around the kind of language that you use. There&#8217;s definitely merit in going and reading it, but you then, one of your team members issued a non rebuttal rebuttal of that piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just for a couple of minutes, let&#8217;s just delve into that. I think his concern is that the way that you portray the report is, let&#8217;s use the word sensational. His argument would be that it&#8217;s in your interest as a provider of security solutions to paint a picture, which is, let&#8217;s say somewhat alarming, there&#8217;s all of these problems, and look at the enormous array of different vulnerabilities that there are out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And therefore you bring the statistics to bear that best represent the fact that there are problems. So just wanted to give you a chance to talk about that. And I will also mention. The rebuttal piece, again on the same website, interestingly, Master WP it&#8217;s by Robert Rowley, they&#8217;re both Robs, so you&#8217;ll probably have to read them one at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is called, rebuttal, how Patchstack is improving WordPress security. So I&#8217;m just giving you a platform here to reply to Rob Howard&#8217;s piece, where he takes you to task for using sensational language and massaging the figures so that they, he accuses you of using sloppy statistics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:08] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, to be honest, I&#8217;m not a hundred percent sure like what is really sensational about that? But in a way, when we put together the whole white paper, we just basically looked at the numbers. We look at the numbers and we are presenting what it is. I understood that one of the things that may be what he thinks about is sensational is the, that there is 150% increase in vulnerabilities being discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is something that we can just say, and it&#8217;s a fact. The question how do you interpret that, whether negative or positive? That needs more context. And the context we do give. The context is that just means that there is more vulnerabilities being identified, which is a good thing because to WordPress is getting more secure because of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when this post was published by Rob, we actually went over it, then we were like, oh, actually there&#8217;s like a lot of good points because obviously we are also a little bit tunnel visioned when we are dealing with that much of data and hooking into the problem that we are trying to solve. And then we&#8217;re obviously talking about that, how we&#8217;re talking in house, in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we should, I get his in terms of like a criticism that we probably should also be more specific in terms of how we are, or like what our intentions behind that are, like whether we see in a negative way or in a positive way. But yeah, like I, we were really happy about the piece that he wrote. We even shared his piece, which wrote criticism about Patchstack on the Patchstack Facebook page, on the Patchstack Twitter. We were like, hey, see what he wrote. There were really good points. And then later on we obviously responded to that with our take on what we actually meant by that and where we thought he may be, in some cases, wrong and where he was right as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:51:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting. Obviously statistics can be in every walk of life, statistics can be looked at in a variety of different ways. And you only have to look at virtually any parliamentary system on earth to realize that the opposition can present the same statistics in an entirely different fashion and it&#8217;s completely plausible and the numbers are correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I think some of the things that he was saying was it would just be nice to have some sort of background, some insight into, so for example, does the increase, this 150% figure that was mentioned, is that because there are more plugins that are out there? How serious are these vulnerabilities that we&#8217;re talking about? If there&#8217;s an increase, but 99% of those were benign and did virtually nothing, could they be lumped in as 150% increase? Has the total number of plugins in the entire market changed? And what are your reporting methodologies in terms of what is it that you&#8217;re actually trying to do from the report? Are you just trying to be a purveyor of information? Or is there a hope from the Patchstack piece that some customers will come your way as well? So just those pieces really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:52:18] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah. I guess if the statistics didn&#8217;t come from like some internal data that we are not showing anyone, it&#8217;s the public CVE&#8217;s that we are one of the authorities to generate the publicly or like the internationally kind of standard vulnerability identification IDs. There&#8217;s three companies in the space which can do that in the WordPress ecosystem. And we&#8217;re one of them. So like this vulnerability information, it&#8217;s all public to the, to everyone, we are just showing that&#8217;s how much there was in 2020. That&#8217;s how much there is in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no kind of translation whether if it was actually not that much of an increase or not. The question isn&#8217;t about about like increase, I guess in general, I think the question is about why it was increasing. And the increase isn&#8217;t because, at this point the increase isn&#8217;t because the WordPress is getting more plugins to the wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We actually, even, I think in the rebuttal piece have shown how much percentage the wordpress.org repo has grown over the year compared to the same period. The thing literally is, there&#8217;s just more eyes. There&#8217;s more people looking for the vulnerabilities in the plugins and they&#8217;re identifying more vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These vulnerabilities may or may not be in there already for years. It&#8217;s the number of vulnerabilities that the 150% of increasing vulnerabilities found in WordPress ecosystem means that there was just 150% more vulnerabilities found in WordPress ecosystem. Basically, it means just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you want to give that positive or negative meaning, it is definitely up to you. Of course we could have tried probably present that in a better way and maybe, I&#8217;m not sure if we actually wrote in our white paper that we find this a good thing. I need to double check it really quickly, but we usually like anywhere we talk, we always say that it&#8217;s a good thing. It is what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting because the language that Rob would like is definitely more on the sort of optimistic side, isn&#8217;t it? So instead of bringing out the things that are going wrong, he would like to emphasize the things that are going right, so for example, he rewrites something where the illustration is that there&#8217;s problems, and he says that a possible alternative headline would be not 0.65% of WordPress sites get an important update. So I guess it&#8217;s stressing the negative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:59] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Would you read that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And that&#8217;s an interesting thing about human nature, isn&#8217;t it? Because you only have to look at newspapers for example, or headlines in articles on the web to realize that well, people are, they&#8217;re drawn to controversy to some extent aren&#8217;t they? They like the sort of sensational aspect. And so yes, interesting point. Yeah, really interesting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:19] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> And in our case, if, when we released the white paper as well, we even saw in some cases where journalists were, we didn&#8217;t tell them what, we didn&#8217;t actually even send it out in that way that all you need to use, like some sort of headlines, but we did see the journalists just take out some piece of data and they would just make their own kind of headline based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a way, I think people need to also think. I understand that, okay, let&#8217;s then talk about this issue in a so positive way that like nobody would even understand that there is like a problem at all. But is that our goal? If we want to make WordPress ecosystem more secure, we need to talk about those issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are issues and these issues are being solved, and we are showing that there is like increased effort in solving those. Let&#8217;s talk about those things. We shouldn&#8217;t just let&#8217;s try to somehow sugar coat it in a way or</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. I will definitely mention both of those articles in the show notes. We&#8217;re going to have to round it up because we&#8217;re approaching the amount of time that we&#8217;ve got. Before we go though, obviously we know that you&#8217;re at Patchstack, which is at patchstack.com. But should anybody wish to reach out to you personally, are there any good ways for people to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:38] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Yeah, anyone can reach out to me on Twitter. I think that&#8217;s the easiest way to reach out either DM or just tag me. It&#8217;s @oliversild. And then yeah, if you want to look at what we are doing. If you&#8217;re a plugin developer, you can always get like security testing for you&#8217;re plugin through Patchstack. If you&#8217;re an agency and you want to have security overview and a vulnerability overview, every single website that you have across your portfolio, then you can use Patchstack for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for hosting companies, we also have so they would always know if new vulnerabilities are being reported to us by the ethical hackers community. Or if we are adding new items to the database from any other sources. So Patchstack database, Patchstack audits. We&#8217;re basically doing anything around WordPress plugins and trying to make the whole ecosystem more secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oliver Sild, thank you very much for joining me on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:35] <strong>Oliver Sild:</strong> Thanks Nathan.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Performance Team Proposes Enabling WebP by Default in WordPress 6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132138\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/performance-team-proposes-enabling-webp-by-default-in-wordpress-6-0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3570:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; Performance Team has published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/28/enabling-webp-by-default/\">feature proposal</a> that would enable WebP images by default, expanding core support for the modern image format. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, 2021, WordPress 5.8 <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">introduced WebP support</a>, allowing users to upload and use WebP images in their content. If the proposal is approved, version 6.0 will generate WebP images by default for new JPEG uploads and will use WebP images by default for website content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WebP was developed as a modern image format that provides superior compression on the web,&#8221; WordPress core contributor Adam Silverstein said in the feature proposal. &#8220;Images are often some of the largest resources used by websites, and using WebP creates websites that are lighter and faster. Compared to JPEG images, WebP images generated by WordPress are almost always smaller, with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/7#issuecomment-1080901577\">~30% file size reduction</a> on average (with the same visual quality).&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WebP enabled by default, WordPress users would not experience any changes to their usual image upload workflow. WordPress would automatically convert JPEG uploads to WebP in the background and use them on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/webp\">Can I Use</a>, the WebP image format is supported by 94.25% of web browsers. A very small number of browsers, such as Internet Explorer 11 or Safari on MacOS &lt; v11 Big Sur, do not support WebP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed feature would ship with two filters to control or disable WebP uploads, and a user-friendly plugin would be created to do the same.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the significant performance benefits, support for the feature proposal is not unopposed. Several contributors participating in the discussion expressed concerns about email clients and social media platforms not supporting WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I feel like WebP is not yet ready to become a &#8216;hardcoded default&#8217; in the <code>post_content</code> due to all the reasons mentioned in the previous comments,&#8221; Kaspars Dambis said. &#8220;Many web clients (which are not just browsers) don’t support WebP formats — RSS clients, email clients, smart TVs, ebook readers, open graph parsers, desktop image viewers, etc. These are all important users of the web.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein answered these concerns, confirming that WordPress will continue generating the JPEG image sub sizes as it always has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One important note about what this feature doesn’t change: JPEG sub sizes are still generated and stored in the same meta fields,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For that reason, consumers of RSS feeds or REST media endpoints or OG tags for example will continue to use the JPEG sub sized versions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance Team contributors are targeting WordPress 6.0 for enabling WebP by default and are seeking approval from maintainers of the image component. Anyone is welcome to test the feature by installing the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab plugin</a> with the “WebP Uploads” module activated. Testers are encouraged to leave feedback on the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443\">Trac ticket</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/2393\">Pull Request</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 02:41:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Text Selection Across Multiple Blocks Is Coming to WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132141\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/text-selection-across-multiple-blocks-is-coming-to-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5371:\"<p>Yesterday, Ella van Durpe merged a long-awaited feature into the Gutenberg plugin that allows users to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38892\">select and modify text across multiple Rich Text blocks</a>. It should land in version 13.0 of the plugin and WordPress 6.0 in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can currently select text across multiple blocks, but the editor automatically adjusts that selection to all of the blocks themselves, essentially creating a group. The change will allow users to highlight the specific text. This ability should work with any Rich Text block, such as Paragraph, Heading, List, and Quote.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting text across two blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who wants to test this feature early can grab a development copy of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38892/checks\">Gutenberg from the ticket.</a> Click on the &#8220;Build Gutenberg Plugin ZIP&#8221; tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is one thing that any text-based editor should do well, it should be to allow users to manipulate text according to standard conventions. Users should be able to select, copy, cut, paste, and generally move characters and words around as they please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When WordPress 5.0 launched its new block-based editor in late 2018, some of the tools that writers had expected were non-existent. Every paragraph, list, heading, and blockquote was a separate entity and not simply a continuation of the text. Blocks were the sludge that plugged the editing flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block system solved a ton of problems that needed solutions. The new post editor even looked sleeker than its classic predecessor. But, those things did not matter much when stuff under the hood did not meet the demands users needed of an editor. Every missing feature that had become a standard to any particular user or another was a blight, another one-star review, on the revolution the block system was meant to bring about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If a user could not do something as simple as select and delete text across two paragraphs, what good were all the other bells and whistles?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is now over three years since the launch of the block editor. Perhaps it is too late to win back some who have chosen a different path for their websites. For others, maybe their writing flows have changed so drastically that the news is inconsequential. For those who have been patiently waiting, knowing that WordPress would one day make this right, it is a moment to rejoice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging by the response to Matías Ventura&#8217;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matias_ventura/status/1508386768864911372\">tweet yesterday</a>, it is a reminder of just how much people have wanted this feature:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Soon you\'d be able to select text across blocks in WordPress while retaining the fundamental mechanics of content blocks. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2604.png\" alt=\"☄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br />Major kudos to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellatrx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ellatrx</a> for the steady work that lead us here! <a href=\"https://t.co/e6tL7r434j\">pic.twitter.com/e6tL7r434j</a></p>&mdash; Matías Ventura (@matias_ventura) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matias_ventura/status/1508386768864911372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The implementation does not yet offer complete coverage of capabilities when selecting text across Rich Text blocks. It currently includes the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Enter:</strong> Hitting the <code>Enter</code> key will delete the selected text and create a new paragraph.</li><li><strong>Backspace:</strong> Hitting the <code>Backspace</code> key removes the selected text and merges anything left of the latter block with the former.</li><li><strong>Delete:</strong> Hitting the <code>Del</code> key removes the selected text and forward merges the previous text.</li><li><strong>Input:</strong> Typing will replace the selected text with new input.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference between <code>Backspace</code> and <code>Del</code> is relevant when dealing with different block types. For example, when highlighting text from a list followed by a paragraph, backspacing will merge the remainder of the paragraph text as a list item. When deleting, the list items become paragraphs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Backspacing selected text across List and Paragraph blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>I did notice a bug when backspacing into a list.  It leaves an empty list item, as shown in the above screenshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still no current method of selecting text from two or more blocks and copying or cutting it. Attempting this falls back to the previous behavior. The copy/cut action grabs the entire block code instead of the text itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Copy action when selecting partial text.\n\n\n\n<p>The new feature does not do away with the ability to partially select text across multiple blocks and manipulate them as a group. Users can still shift their position, copy them, and modify them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the text-selection feature is an enhancement to the current tools, and it is one that many will be happy to see land in WordPress.  It is not a complete set of capabilities, but this is a win for the project and a necessary step forward.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 01:38:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Asia 2023 Tentatively Set For February 17-19 in Bangkok, Thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132098\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-2023-tentatively-set-for-february-17-19-in-bangkok-thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2996:\"<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Asia</a> is tentatively back on the schedule of in-person WordPress events with new dates: February 17-19, 2023, in Bangkok, Thailand. It will begin with a Contributor day, followed by two conference days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asia&#8217;s inaugural flagship WordCamp was originally scheduled for March 2020 but was the first international WordPress event to be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-2020-canceled-over-covid-19-concerns\">cancelled due to the pandemic</a>. It was cancelled just nine days before it was scheduled to happen, a difficult but necessary decision, despite all the hard work volunteers had invested. At that time, organizers hoped to push the event to the next year, but the pandemic forced it to be put on hold again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community in Asia is quite large and spans across a wide land area with many diverse cultures. Prior to the pandemic, Asia was home to 127 WordPress meetup chapters with 73,000 members across 23 countries. The region had hosted 137 WordCamps in 18 Asian countries and 52 cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia organizers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019\">began preliminary planning in 2017</a>, inspired by other successful regional camps. Five years later, they have once again <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-organisers/\">opened the call for organizers</a>. They are aiming to build a team of 15 local (Thai) organizers and 30-35 organizers from other parts of Asia. This group will be broken up into teams that will lead audio/visual tech, design, speakers, volunteers, and other practical aspects of event planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prospective organizers must reside in Asia and have experience organizing meetups or WordCamps. They must also be willing to commit at least three hours per week for planning and meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because the main venue will be the same place as originally planned, we will be able to reuse some work from 2020,&#8221; organizer Naoko Takano said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will comply with any COVID-19 guidelines provided by the local government and WordPress Community Team (<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/01/24/updated-guidelines-for-in-person-wordcamps-and-meetups-2022/\">such as this one</a>) to ensure the safety of the attendees.&#8221; If for some reason the event needs to be postponed again, organizers have a much more structured approach to managing this risk and making decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After five years of planning and so many unavoidable delays, the persistence and resilience of WordCamp Asia&#8217;s organizers is admirable. The call to join their team is open until April 30, and selected organizers will be notified by mid-May.

Anyone with a WordPress.org account can log in, go to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/new-pattern/\">pattern creator</a>, and start designing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some of us, this has felt like an unbearably long wait. In reality, it took the development team less than a year since the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-org-block-pattern-directory-now-live\">directory launch</a> to put this together. It was no small feat to make it work and put in all the guardrails for such a system in that amount of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some community members have already got a head start. Ana Segota of Anariel Design announced <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ana_Segota/status/1507407534650445831\">via Twitter</a> that three of her patterns had already landed. &#8220;More coming soon,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/author/anariel-design/\">Patterns by Anariel Design.</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern directory has the potential to be an onramp for creators who want to contribute to the WordPress project but do not know where to start. The barrier to entry is one of the lowest in the community. There is no requirement to write code or understand all the intricacies of theme design. It is nowhere near as complex as plugin development. It is simply a visual builder that allows sharing art with the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea where this thing is going. I hope to see 1,000s of patterns in the directory a year from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I played a small role in building two of the initial patterns from last year. I was excited about the potential for the directory and happy to contribute in any way. However, I was not entirely satisfied with the process because I did not have the creative freedom I wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, my vision for an &#8220;about me&#8221; columns pattern had <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/about-me-cards/\">morphed into something entirely different</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Final about me cards pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>By the time it was added to the directory, there was hardly any of myself in it. The first designs that launched were tightly curated, and that was OK. It was more about getting production-ready patterns out to users at the time, and I knew that WordPress.org would eventually open it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I started work anew, rebuilding my original &#8220;about me&#8221; pattern. I have made some alterations because we now have new spacing controls. And the built-in, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/openverse/\">Openverse</a>-powered search did not seem to locate some of my early images, despite being available via the Openverse site. Nevertheless, it is a work in progress:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Building with the new pattern creator.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can save draft patterns, too. So, if you want to try your hand at designing one but are unsure if you can finish it in one sitting or do not have a fully-fleshed-out idea, there is no need to worry about losing work. You can save it and pull it up later from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/my-patterns/\">your patterns page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern creator runs Twenty Twenty-One under the hood. The classic theme has a few quirks, CSS that often overrules the core WordPress styles. I would rather have seen Twenty Twenty-Two because it sticks much more closely to the global styles standard. At least people who want to try designing off-site will be able to test with a similar setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns should, ideally, be theme-agnostic. However, in practice, the theme that showcases those patterns &#8212; Twenty Twenty-One in this case &#8212; can make or break a design. Creators should not design specifically for it, but they should at least check its output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the pattern creator is straightforward. It is merely an instance of the block editor with some modifications specific to the directory. It also provides a quick welcome screen:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Welcome screen to the pattern creator.\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, my experience with it went reasonably well for a Day 1 launch. Most of the hiccups that I encountered were with the image search. It timed out on occasion, and filtering images was not a perfect experience. Despite being powered by Openverse, it does not offer the same filtering tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that the pattern creator will eventually tie into the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/\">WordPress photo directory</a>. The built-in search is a neat tool, but you sometimes have to wade through dozens or hundreds of outdated images to find something worth using. The photo directory feels fresh and modern. Plus, we should be prioritizing the work of those contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still many <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues\">open tickets</a> for the pattern directory, and it will undoubtedly evolve based on feedback and usage. However, this is a solid launch of the pattern creator. Well done to all the folks who made this happen.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 03:16:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Store API Now Stable, Provides Better Support for Custom Frontends\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=132009\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-store-api-now-stable-provides-better-support-for-custom-frontends\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5730:\"<p>WooCommerce <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/03/25/store-api-is-now-considered-stable/\">announced</a> today that its new Store API is now stable after two years in development. It powers the plugin&#8217;s new block-based cart and checkout experience as well as all products blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Store API is a public, unauthenticated API, that provides REST API endpoints for cart, checkout, and product functionality. WooCommerce core developer Mike Jolley explained how the new API is different from the plugin&#8217;s REST API:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The main difference between the Store API and WC REST API is that the Store API&nbsp;<strong>allows unauthenticated access</strong>&nbsp;to store data, for example, products. This makes it suitable for a variety of use-cases, including custom frontends.</p><p>This is an&nbsp;<strong>unauthenticated API</strong>. It does not require API keys or authentication tokens for access.</p><p>Another difference is that the Store API has support for&nbsp;<strong>Cart data.</strong>&nbsp;This allows for cart operations such as adding items to the cart, updating quantities, applying coupons, and submitting orders. Only the current customer’s cart can be accessed.</p><p>Data returned from the Store API is always reflective of the current user (cookie-based), whereas the WC REST API allows more extensive access to any data, should you have the correct access rights.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://hollerwp.com/mike-jolley-interview/\">interview with HollerWP</a> last year, Jolley said it&#8217;s helpful to think of the Store API as for clients and the core REST API as the API for store management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Keeping them separate like this makes it clear that one exposes data in a public context,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott Bolinger, co-founder of <a href=\"https://apppresser.com/\">AppPresser</a>, explained how the Store API fixes a problem with the original WooCommerce REST API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It [the WC REST API] was never meant for mobile, headless, or any other front end implementation,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;It was only meant for back end admin stuff like inventory, adding/removing products, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that there was no alternative, so headless/mobile apps used it for displaying products. With the WC REST API, everything requires authentication, which doesn’t make sense, because products are public on your website. You shouldn’t have to authenticate to see someone’s products.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Store API allows developers to get products, attributes, collections, and other data without authentication, and adds a cart API, making it possible to checkout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think most implementations of the WC Rest API that are for the front end should switch to the Store API,&#8221; Bolinger said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce team is still working on making this API suitable for headless and mobile apps. In an ideal world, the best cart API for headless WooCommerce apps would be made by WooCommerce. In the meantime, Bolinger recommended <a href=\"https://cocart.xyz/\">CoCart</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CoCart is a customizable, WordPress REST API for WooCommerce that allows developers to build headless (or decoupled) e-commerce stores using their choice of frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not using the Store API and I don&#8217;t see that I will,&#8221; Co-Cart founder Sébastien Dumont said. &#8220;Both API&#8217;s are unique for their individual purposes. WooCommerce&#8217;s Store API is designed for the Gutenberg blocks, which only requires a fixed format and is still prone to be used on native storefronts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see today&#8217;s news affecting CoCart. Most of my users have already known about the Store API while it was still experiential and failed after trying it for headless purposes. It also requires tweaking while CoCart does not&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dumont said the Store API is still missing a lot of valuable information that developers require and that using CoCart saves them considerable development time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the WC Rest API, there is no cart or checkout, so it’s cool they added that,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;Nonces only work when you are on the site though, so for mobile apps or headless WP, you will run into issues. Unfortunately it’s not where it needs to be for headless (yet).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a filter to disable nonce authentication: <code>add_filter( \'woocommerce_store_api_disable_nonce_check\', \'__return_true\' );</code> Even changing this to use something like JWT won’t fully work for headless, at least in my testing. I hope they will address this in the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/issues/5683\">issue</a> is still open on the WooCommerce GitHub repository. Maintainers seem open to exploring how core can accommodate this. In the meantime, third-party solutions are available to developers building mobile apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a technical breakdown of what&#8217;s currently possible with the new Store API, check out Mike Jolley&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/03/25/store-api-is-now-considered-stable/\">announcement</a> post. He demonstrated how you can go through the entire purchase flow using the Insomnia API client- without even visiting the store.

It\'s also being used by Russian civilians <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(military_symbol)\">as a sign of support for the ongoing invasion</a> of Ukraine. The colors and ribbon of St. George are often used with the &#8216;Z\', and the Lithuanian parliament has <a href=\"https://hromadske.radio/en/news/2022/03/24/in-lithuania-parliament-puts-up-proposal-to-equate-the-z-symbol-and-the-ribbon-of-st-george-with-the-nazi-symbols\">proposed banning and equating</a> them with Nazi and Communist images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/z-is-the-symbol-of-the-new-russian-politics-of-aggression\">Earlier this month</a>, <strong>Masha Gessen</strong> described the &#8216;Z\' in <strong>The New Yorker</strong> as having come &#8220;to stand for devotion to the state, murderous rage, and unchecked power.&#8221; While Gessen\'s definition stopped short of calling &#8216;Z\' a hate symbol in early March, it has been affirmed as one since then — definitely in the view of many Ukrainians. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Russians have chosen the letter Z as the symbol for their invasion of Ukraine.

(There are quite a few pro-Ukraine plugins in the .org repo.) The forked plugin\'s author called it <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/zamir/\">Zamir</a></strong> and made it &#8220;display the `Z` symbol in support of Russia.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin was submitted for review, and it was approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220323182342/https://wordpress.org/plugins/zamir/\">how the Zamir plugin page looked</a> before it was taken down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-first-reactions-on-twitter-and-post-status-slack\">First Reactions on Twitter and Post Status Slack</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When Zamir appeared in the WordPress plugin repository, it was very quickly noticed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rarst/status/1506681883404472324\">with many</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ciorici/status/1506663406060851200\">negative reactions</a> on <strong>Twitter</strong>. Apart from complaints about the plugin being morally offensive, many people felt it violated the guidelines plugins must follow to be accepted in the WordPress.org repo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While reactions on Twitter exploded, a heated conversation opened in the main <code>#club</code> channel in <strong>Post Status Slack</strong>. Initially, there was shock and dismay that the Zamir plugin was appearing prominently on the new plugin list for all WordPress.com customers. One of the first to notice the plugin and recognize its significance, <strong>Carl Hancock</strong> fired off a terse takedown request to the plugin review team, which he shared in Post Status Slack. The request was denied, and Carl shared <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1648053721931799\">the response he received</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among Post Status members, the discussion was focused on whether the plugin should (or could) be removed under current guidelines. There was no disagreement on it being offensive, although not everyone knew about the &#8216;Z\' symbol\'s emerging significance. The <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-as-a-commons/\">lack of protocols and governance</a> in place to handle a situation like this was noted by several people, including <strong>Lesley Sim</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You know what would be cool? If the guidelines had examples or precedents so that we would have something more tangible to go on. Not just subject to everyone\'s interpretations which, clearly, we all seem to disagree on. Kinda like case law in the legal system.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-openness-of-making-wordpress-despite-unclear-decision-procedures\">The Openness of Making WordPress Despite Unclear Decision Procedures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Making WordPress <code>#pluginreview</code> Slack channel had a Zamir discussion underway at the same time, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C1LBM36LC/p1648057102435389\">an initial response</a> from <strong>Mika Epstein</strong> to confirm that the plugin had been approved. (Anyone interested in how WordPress gets made should read the open and transparent discussion in the plugin review channel for context.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very quickly a number of people in the <strong>WordPress Foundation</strong> examined the situation and took some time to make a decision. The plugin was taken down, and <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> posted an explanation of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/03/23/removal-of-the-zamir-plugin/\">why Zamir violated community guidelines</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>While it is true that there is no current plugin guideline barring plugins that “support” political leanings, this icon symbolizes something more complicated than that. Contributors were right to report this and, with their help and the help of WordPress community members, the plugin has been removed from the directory.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Josepha, &#8220;The plugin’s description eluded initial plugin checks.&#8221; Even if it was an honest oversight, which appears to be the case, it still raises some important questions about review procedures and governance for WordPress.org. To Josepha\'s credit she does this address this:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I am aware that this issue leads to natural questions about clarifying our plugin policies moving forward. I’ll work with the community to explore our guidelines and create a clearer framework for how plugins can be evaluated in the context of current events.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-don-t-assume-the-worst-of-others\">Don\'t Assume the Worst of Others</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> also <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1648089238895559\">shared some thoughts</a> in Post Status Slack after the Zamir plugin\'s takedown:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Thank you to everyone who raised this issue, regardless of how you did it&#8230; Extra thanks to people who did it in a way knowing there are humans on the other side of the screen, and sometimes it may take a few hours to respond to something. This moved pretty quickly, but if it had happened in the middle of the night on a holiday or something similar it could have taken longer.</p><p>100% promise there will be mistakes or things we reverse in the future. What\'s important isn\'t trying to avoid mistakes, as that\'s impossible, but responding to them in a thoughtful and hopefully fast way. Please don\'t bash people or teams for making a mistake, we\'re all human and fallible.</p><p>Thank you as well to those who didn\'t jump to conclusions based on this one plugin being up for a few hours.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t seem there was any ill-will from anyone involved in the plugin\'s entry into the repo or in the removal of some hostile &#8220;reviews&#8221; in the plugin support forum before its removal. I hope we can take a lesson from this and reexamine the plugin review policies, including how takedown requests work. The procedures and policies for removal need to be clear to everyone. </p>\n\n\n.kt-block-spacer-_bb762c-8f .kt-divider{width:80%;}\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-_bb762c-8f\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-7 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-post-status-postscript\"><strong>Post Status Postscript</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The saddest and most concerning part of this story — and the part of it that is not likely to go away soon — is how anger and suspicion quickly focused a very prejudicial eye on contributors who might be Russian and/or sympathetic to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Plugin Review team and a moderator in the Support Forum who is also on the Russian language Translation Team became the target of hasty scrutiny from the outside. Even within the Make WordPress Slack channels for those teams, there was some emotional and accusatory communication. <br /><br />That\'s understandable; I had similar suspicions myself. But the reality is the plugin review team is constantly making good-faith efforts as they carry out a very difficult and essential task. They will never please everyone all the time. They are targets of complaints, criticism, and even <a href=\"https://halfelf.org/2021/when-its-not-burnout/\">hateful, violent threats directed at individual members</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The suspicion and distrust that flared up in the Zamir controversy underscores the very serious risks facing all open source projects now. Loss of the trust and goodwill that makes open source possible could kill it. David and I emphasize this in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/an-inside-job/\">our discussion</a> of &#8220;weaponized open-source code.&#8221; What a terrible phrase! Even using code as a form of political protest against a specific nation may harm open source by dividing us with deep distrust. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s probably good to have gotten through the Zamir plugin debacle as a relatively harmless learning experience. It could have been worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it may well get worse. It will definitely get more complicated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other scenarios come to mind. What if instead of the &#8216;Z\' — a fairly explicit hate symbol — the flag of the Russian Federation had been used? <br /><br />So what\'s to be done, constructively? At a minimum, we need the greater transparency that\'s increasingly being called for in the WordPress community. Formal guidelines, processes, and roles will provide clarity about who decides, and how they decide to include or exclude plugins, themes, reviews, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it will always be messy, and there will always be mistakes. Project and community boundaries necessarily differ and disagree. That is exactly why everyone needs to know what the boundaries are and how they are negotiated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><strong>— Dan Knauss</strong></p>\n</div></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 17:47:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"David Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress.org blog: Get Creative with the All-New Pattern Creator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12460\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/get-creative-with-the-all-new-pattern-creator/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3130:\"<p>It’s been less than a year since the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Pattern Directory</a> was launched, and we already have more exciting news to share. <strong>The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/new-pattern/\" target=\"_blank\">Pattern Creator</a> is live!

He\'s right it goes beyond protest, especially in the case of the destructive Node library:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;In my mind, the term &#8216;protestware\' is attempting to legitimize the malicious actions and very much turns open source libraries into weapons to be aimed and fired at your opponent&#8230; I do think that these actions are to be condemned — especially as the “delete files based on geofencing IP addresses” has got the potential of causing collateral damage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-collateral-damage-to-trust-in-open-source-could-kill-it\">Collateral damage to trust in open source could kill it.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The deeper (and probably the worst) unintended consequence is the loss of trust in the open-source community. Benischke asks if it\'s even open-source code if you can\'t trust it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Open Source Initiative</strong> <strong>(OSI) </strong>has <a href=\"https://opensource.org/blog/open-source-protestware-harms-open-source\">a positive, agreeing response</a> to Benischke\'s post. OSI supports &#8220;creative&#8221; forms of &#8220;protestware&#8221; that are informational or symbolic, but they distinguish this from weaponized code, which they condemn. However, OSI does not mention trust at all or the consequences of losing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does trust matter so much? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\'t trust your dependencies, who is in a position to take ownership of them all to ensure their secure functioning? Benischke points out that only a few large companies allied with the most powerful nations could afford to do this. Exclusive multinational blocs using trusted but closed source software might emerge if we go down this path. And it\'s not as if we didn\'t already have enormous challenges with security, maintenance, project sustainability, and the &#8220;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/missing-the-bus/\">bus factor</a>.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why Benischke\'s concerns about the death of trust as a lethal poison are not far-fetched or of secondary importance to WordPress and open source.  If anything, he understates the precarity of the moment we are in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What about you?</strong> Let us know <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/planet/feed/#comment\">in the comments</a>. </p>\n\n\n.kt-block-spacer-_31bf24-7a .kt-divider{width:80%;}\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-_31bf24-7a\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-9 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-post-status-postscript\"><strong>Post Status Postscript</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"h-wordpress-may-not-be-interested-in-the-us-department-of-defense-but-the-dod-is-interested-in-wordpress\">WordPress may not be interested in the US Department of Defense, but the DoD is interested in WordPress</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn\'t hard to see the weaponization of open source coming long ago. I just thought it would be done by malign individuals and organizations outside the open-source community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Government actors have been <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/the_nsa_is_brea.html\">exploiting open (and closed) source code to spy on and harm enemies</a> for a long time. I just didn\'t think it would be members of open source projects doing this themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we\'ve experienced this in the WordPress community, with the Zamir plugin. (See our related thoughts on that story <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/fall-of-the-zamir\">over here</a>.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These developments are all very concerning. I hope it\'s not as bad as <strong>Heather Burns</strong> says it is, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WebDevLaw/status/1506712423230849030\">she may be right</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default has-small-font-size\"><p>&#8220;The .org OSS project is entirely legally controlled by a US company which could, at any time, fall under scrutiny for providing services to Russia, or be brought into the sanctions regime.&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WebDevLaw/status/1506712423230849030\">Heather Burns @WebDevLaw</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this how we need to think now, of globalized, international, open-source projects and communities? In a somewhat paranoid, suspicious way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagining the worst — the ways open source could be destroyed — reminds me of a conversation I had at the last <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/partner-summit/\">Post Status Partners Retreat</a></strong>. I asked a WordPress OG why he thought there always seems to be a constant sense of anxiety in the WordPress community — as if a massive disaster is just around the corner. I haven\'t seen that in other projects that are healthy even if they have a much smaller market share — like <strong>Drupal</strong>, for instance. (Speaking of which, you should check out <strong>Amy June Hineline</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-excerpt-no-51-comparing-the-drupal-and-wordpress-communities-with-amy-june-hineline/\">comparison of the Drupal and WordPress communities</a> in her recent chat with David.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My question led to the response that only WordPress can destroy WordPress, it\'s so big. Then we had some fun imagining &#8220;evil&#8221; self-sabotage scenarios that might realistically play out if things went sideways. Later I posed this as a thought experiment with other people — imagine a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screwtape_Letters\">Screwtape Letters</a></em> take on WordPress. What would a clever demon do to ruin the project by manipulating its insiders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the worst-case scenarios, most people agreed that some massive corporations are so dependent on WordPress, they would take it over in their own — in-house (and likely as good as proprietary) distribution. WordPress would not die. The project as we know it might die. The community would die. The software, at the end of the day, is the most durable thing — but it\'s not worth much to us if it\'s torn away from open source freedoms and an open, cooperative community of contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can an open-source community like ours survive abandoning a fully globalized, international openness — at least as a possibility and ideal? Would survival in that context be worth anything, or be truly open? I don\'t think so. But we\'re now looking at a darkening world where every open-source project has reason to worry about that as a non-zero possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><strong>— Dan Knauss</strong></p>\n</div></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 17:11:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"David Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: How To Build a Two-Column Single Post Header with the WordPress Site Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=131951\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-build-a-two-column-single-post-header-with-the-wordpress-site-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8719:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the features I liked about <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-archeo-wordpress-theme-blends-mayan-history-with-magazine-style-block-patterns\">Automattic&#8217;s Archeo theme</a> that I reviewed earlier this week was its split-screen single post header. I loved that an author was doing a little something different with the Featured Image block, giving users some variety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design was simple. It is a two-column section with an image on the right and the post title and date on the left.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Split-screen post title and image.\n\n\n\n<p>It reminded me to dust off one of the untold numbers of &#8220;ideas&#8221; folders on my computer. I knew I had built something similar last year. I merely needed to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I finally stumbled upon it after a bit of rummaging &#8212; <em>I really need to learn how to name things to make them easier to find</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Old split post header design idea.\n\n\n\n<p>My approach to the problem was different, and I remember why it went to the scrap-heap. It used the Media &amp; Text block instead of Columns. Then, and this is still the case, it is impossible to use the Featured Image inside of Media &amp; Text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Columns block is a decent second choice, but it stacks differently on mobile views, with the first column always landing on top. The image takes precedence when using the Media &amp; Text block, regardless of its horizontal position on desktop views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an open ticket to use the post&#8217;s featured image <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35221\">within the Media &amp; Text block</a>. There is a similar ticket for using it <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13795\">within a Cover</a>. Both would be solved by addressing an issue that would have farther reach by allowing <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37753\">generic blocks to utilize site or post metadata</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least for now, we must work with the tools we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this entry in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/building-with-blocks\">Building with Blocks</a> series, I will walk you through modifying Twenty Twenty-Two&#8217;s single post template to create a similar layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is hard for some people to visualize the result without the post data. As shown in the following screenshot, the editor has placeholders:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Editor view of split-screen post header.\n\n\n\n<p>However, those placeholders will be transformed on the front end. <em>How do we know that what we see there will translate correctly and turn out like the following?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img />Front-end view of single post with split-screen header.\n\n\n\n<p>Even I struggle with this visualization at times. The placeholders used for Post* blocks do not offer me enough direct feedback, so I often refresh an example post on the front end as I build layouts like this. I wanted to note this in case it disorients or even throws anyone else off. It is OK to save and check your work on the front end as you go through this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Side note:</strong> <em>I would love to see a plugin that adds dummy post data instead of the default placeholders.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 1: Selecting the Single Post Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Select the Single Post template.\n\n\n\n<p>To make this layout change for all single posts, you must go to the site editor via Appearance &gt; Editor in the admin. Select the WordPress logo/icon in the top left corner to open the slide-out panel. From there, click on the Templates link. The next screen should display a list of editable templates. Select &#8220;Single Post.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer to make this an optional template, you should build this from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/16/introducing-the-template-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">template editor</a>. The process is similar, but the UI does have some differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Adjusting Site Header (Optional)</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adjusting header Row blocks&#8217; alignment and padding.\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two&#8217;s header does not work well for the type of layout that we are building. It has a ton of padding at the bottom, and its width is limited. You will want to make a few changes for a more ideal design. Note that this will change the header across the entire site unless you save it as a separate template part. This step is optional, but the final result will look better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Header area of the editor, select the Row block that holds the Site Title and Navigation blocks. From the toolbar, select the &#8220;Full width&#8221; alignment option. In the block sidebar panel on the right, set the &#8220;Padding&#8221; option to <code>2rem</code> or a value of your preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Creating Columns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Wrapping the Post Title and Post Featured Image blocks in columns.\n\n\n\n<p>Because Twenty Twenty-Two already has the Post Title and Post Featured Image blocks grouped together, there is no need to start from scratch here. Select both with your mouse or keyboard, click the &#8220;Transform To&#8221; button in the toolbar, and choose the Columns option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If working from a theme with a different layout, you can manually add a Columns block with a 50/50 setting and insert the Post Title and Post Featured Image blocks in the two columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 4: Designing Columns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adjusting alignment, colors, and padding of Columns block.\n\n\n\n<p>We have gotten some of the boring layout stuff out of the way. Now, you can start adding your own brand of artistry to this thing. I chose a black background and white text for the Columns block. However, feel free to add whatever colors you want. Maybe even try out the border options to mix it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now, back to boring layout adjustments.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this layout to work, there are two changes you should make to the Columns block. First, select the &#8220;Full width&#8221; alignment from the toolbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, change the &#8220;Padding&#8221; option in the block sidebar to <code>0</code>. Zeroing this out allows the featured image to stretch to the edge. This is not a hard requirement if you want a little space around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 5: Title Group</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Grouping the Post Title block and adding some padding.\n\n\n\n<p>Because we zeroed out the padding in the previous step, the Post Title block will now butt against the side of the layout. Text always needs room to breathe in design, so we need to fix this problem we have created for ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways of going about this. The first is to simply add padding to the Column block that the Post Title is in. This should work fine, but WordPress does not handle this well (it does not use <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> for Column blocks). If you add padding here, it will make the left side wider than the right. Unfortunately, this is a little quirk that creates extra work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best option is to select the Post Title and transform it into a Group. Then, find the &#8220;Padding&#8221; control in the sidebar and change it to <code>2rem</code> or your preferred value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some themes may correct the column-padding issue, so give the first option a shot if using something other than Twenty Twenty-Two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 6: Adjusting Featured Image</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Removing margin from Post Featured Image block.\n\n\n\n<p>Neither WordPress nor Twenty Twenty-Two adds any default margin handling for the Post Featured Image block. The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> wrapping element will fall back to the browser&#8217;s default (browsers generally add some margin to the top and bottom).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that the image does not have extra spacing, select it in the editor, find the &#8220;Margin&#8221; setting in the sidebar, and set it to <code>0</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 7: Have Fun</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Customized split-screen post header.\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation of the layout is in place now. Adjusting paddings, margins, and similar settings is the giant mountain you must conquer to do some of the <em>really</em> cool stuff that is possible. I do not want to limit folks with the rest of the design and would love for everyone to put their own spin on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I changed the vertical alignment on the Columns block to the &#8220;Align bottom&#8221; setting for my layout. Above the Post Title, I added a Row with the Post Author Name, Post Date, and Post Categories blocks. I also removed the Separator that Twenty Twenty-Two adds before the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please share customizations you made in the comments if you followed along with this tutorial.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 04:42:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Post Status: Finding the Upside in WordPress Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=95029\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/finding-the-upside-in-wordpress-security/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6252:\"<h3>Can exposing security vulnerabilities in the open be done in a way that doesn\'t hurt WordPress?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>Rob Howard</strong>, who recently acquired <strong>MasterWP</strong>, used it last week to <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/is-wordpress-security-getting-better-or-worse/\">criticize</a> <strong>Patchstack</strong>’s <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/whitepaper/the-state-of-wordpress-security-in-2021/\">Security WhitePaper for 2021</a>. He called the report &#8220;sensationalist&#8221; with &#8220;sloppy data reporting,&#8221; &#8220;too much information,&#8221; and some important good news left out. He also advocated &#8220;WordPress security messaging&#8221; that would clean up the &#8220;wasteland of poorly framed articles about security patches&#8221; in <strong>Google News</strong>. We thought that is <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/would-wordpress-benefit-from-public-relations-messaging-around-security-issues/\">a worthwhile and promising idea to develop</a>. However, Rob expressed skepticism that security companies have an interest in accentuating the positive. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>What if the way we talk about WordPress security focused on public acknowledgement of the security team members\' work, goals, and successes?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Patchstack Security Advocate <strong>Robert Rowley</strong> has written a response in MasterWP. Robert countered that Patchstack is helping &#8220;open source projects reach security maturity.&#8221;&nbsp;In <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/rebuttal-how-patchstack-is-improving-wordpress-security/\">a polite &#8220;rebutal-but-not-a-rebuttal response,&#8221;</a> he explains Patchstack\'s perspective and intentions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Robert, the large increase in vulnerabilities emphasized in Patchstack\'s report has to do with an increase in code review and bug reporting. WordPress core is secure, and increased attention to vulnerabilities in themes and plugins is a good thing. Patchstack is helping that happen, in their view. &#8220;Vulnerability disclosure for the commons&#8221; is how they understand what they\'re doing with projects like <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/alliance/\">The Patchstack Alliance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-11 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-7-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h4>What we\'ve learned and agree on about WordPress security:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are two good, compatible takeaways from this discussion everyone seems to agree on</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>WordPress is getting more secure, and open source ways of addressing vulnerabilities openly together is helping.</li><li>WordPress could benefit from (and deserves) better messaging about security that contextualizes it in open source values and practices where we give and grow together. </li></ol>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><strong>A noteworthy aside:</strong> Robert brought up <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/are-active-installs-of-wordpress-plugins-declining-in-2021/\">some numbers we rarely see that I follow closely</a>. The WordPress.org plugin repository grew by less than 3% in 2021, from 58,151 to 59,800 plugins. Themes grew by around 10%. That\'s decent growth in both cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-can-we-do-security-related-messaging-better-for-wordpress\">How can we do security-related messaging better for WordPress?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the discussion began between Robert and Rob, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/would-wordpress-benefit-from-public-relations-messaging-around-security-issues/\">we posed this question</a> here at <strong>Post Status</strong>: <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/would-wordpress-benefit-from-public-relations-messaging-around-security-issues/\">Would WordPress benefit from public relations messaging around security issues?</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02S57UHCKD/p1647876595955309\">responded</a> in <strong>Post Status Slack</strong>: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;There are many teams in the open source WordPress project who publicly share details on progress, metrics and planning&#8230; I would disagree with calling this PR, that has some other connotations.

Instead of “core vulnerabilities reported” it could be “security code pushed” or “release improvements.” Why not educate on what open source is and updating is a good thing, not something to fear?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert agreed with Kim\'s approach and acknowledged it was a mistake to have used the term &#8220;vulnerabilities&#8221; rather than &#8220;security bugs patched.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress is different, and we should embrace that</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good approach moving forward. It doesn\'t matter what company or open source project you are working with. If you are releasing information about security and your product, you need to educate and reassure your audiences. WordPress is not selling the same experience as other (especially non-open-source) web publishing platforms. <strong>Wix</strong> and <strong>Shopify</strong> only make public the security information they\'re legally obligated to release. When they do they are often on the defensive.

This is the first time the Paris-based company has taken outside capital since it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/weglot-multilingual-plugin-closes-450k-in-seed-funding\">closed €450K in seed funding</a> from SIDE Capital in 2017. Since that initial round Weglot has expanded its offerings to include more translations and integrations for other platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weglot co-founder Augustin Prot confirmed that the company is profitable with 25k customers paying for its SaaS translation platform and 60k+ websites using the company&#8217;s products, including IBM, Microsoft, Spotify, Steve Madden, and Volcom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Weglot <a href=\"https://weglot.com/blog/2021-year-in-review/\">passed €10M ARR</a>, primarily through the sale of its WordPress, Shopify, and Webflow products, but the company also has growing user bases on Squarespace, Wix, Magento, BigCommerce, Square Online, and Salesforce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weglot has a free version of its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/weglot/\">plugin on WordPress.org</a> for small websites (under 2,000 words) with one translation language. It includes a Gutenberg block that makes it easy for users to position and customize their language switcher. The plugin has 40,000 active installs. Commercial plans range from €99/year for 10,000 words and one translated language to €4,990/year for 5 million words and 20 translated languages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weglot&#8217;s chief competitors are <a href=\"https://wpml.org/\">WPML</a> (a commercial product with no free version) and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/\">Polylang</a> (700K installs), a free plugin with a pro version that provides additional features and support. Despite having a much smaller WordPress user base and going up against more established competitors, Prot said the company is aiming to &#8220;become the category leader for web translation.&#8221; Weglot employs a team of 30 people and plans to use the new funding to hire more over the coming year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We found success by focusing on usability and simplicity,&#8221; Prot said. &#8220;The SaaS model allows us to develop very quickly on the product side and the plugin is based on users’ and customers’ feedback. If you don’t take that into account they would simply leave. That’s why the SaaS approach favors continuous and fast improvement to make sure we match users’ expectations.&#8221; </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 01:39:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Post Status: Post Status Comments (No. 6) — Getting Up To Speed On PHP News\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=94825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-comments-no-6-getting-up-to-speed-on-php-news/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4982:\"<h2 id=\"h-these-php-deprecation-notices-are-warnings-to-project-managers-and-developers-do-we-have-enough-time-for-wordpress-core-but-especially-the-community-to-fix-the-codebases-tonya-mork\">“These [PHP] deprecation notices are warnings to project managers and developers… do we have enough time for [WordPress] core but especially the community to fix the codebases?” — Tonya Mork</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Anyone seriously invested in WordPress, from developers to agency owners, has a big stake in the primary language WordPress is built with: <strong>PHP</strong>. WordPress professionals have a lot to keep track of, so it\'s not surprising they often overlook important news from the PHP community and development team. To bring you up to speed, <strong>David Bisset</strong> speaks with <strong>Carl Alexander</strong> and <strong>Tonya Mork</strong> in this episode of The Excerpt. Tonya and Carl have been deep into WordPress and PHP for many years. Here they offer a &#8220;Cliffs Notes&#8221; take on the PHP news the WordPress community should be paying attention to now. This includes big changes to code for developers and the need for a <strong>PHP Foundation</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why This Is Important:</strong> WordPress depends on PHP, so developers and professionals should be aware of what is coming down the road as features are added, modified, and deprecated. There are also challenges of governance and sustainability that PHP is facing now that impact WordPress and relate to similar issues in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\"><strong>Post Status Comments</strong> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4ac.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> is a stage for WordPress professionals to exchange ideas and talk about recent topics and trends.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/comments/\">Browse past episodes</a> and subscribe to <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcasts/\">our podcasts</a> on&nbsp; <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1m3xwXbe0MG5BzFVPtB0A7\">Spotify</a>, Amazon Music, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://castro.fm/podcast/c53552c6-1ee0-4fc4-9de4-08ed6bf1ee4d\">Castro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/wordpress-post-status-podcasts\">Player.fm</a>, <a href=\"https://pca.st/05rR\">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\">Simplecast</a>, or get them by <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"%f0%9f%99%8f-sponsor-godaddy-pro\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/godaddy-pro\">GoDaddy Pro</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your clients, websites, and tasks from a single dashboard with <strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong>.

One of my biggest pet peeves is when themers simply dump it at the top of the content and call it a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I nearly always bolt straight for the site editor to remove the single-post featured image upon installing block themes from some authors. However, after installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/archeo/\">Archeo</a>, Automattic&#8217;s latest, I simply let it be. At least in this instance, the implementation did not make me wonder if we were ever going to get this whole block-based theme venture <em>right</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Split-screen post title and featured image.\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the single-post header design is that it works with the limited toolset offered by the current Featured Image block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is one knit-pick I have it is that the post and site titles do not align on the left side of the page, at least on wide-desktop views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So, the single-post header is well-designed. How does the rest of the theme hold up?</em> I am getting to that, but every now and again, something special about a design catches my eye. And, I cannot wait to let others know about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic is the most prolific block theme creator to date. Its Theme Team has rolled out a dozen designs to the WordPress directory over the last year. Many of its initial outings had a familiar feel &#8212; tiny variations on a simple base. However, things have livened up recently. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattics-livro-is-a-minimal-block-theme-for-writers\">Livro</a>, the dark theme that made me dislike dark themes a little less, and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/skatepark-is-a-bold-and-vibrant-block-theme-for-events-and-organizations\">Skatepark</a>, a unique experiment in its own right, represented a fresh start after the previous months began to feel stale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archeo continues that momentum. The theme is bold when it needs to be while making enough use of whitespace to not overwhelm readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Intro section of Archeo&#8217;s homepage.\n\n\n\n<p>It is one of the few faithful representations of magazine designs that I have seen. No, I am not talking about the muddied term in some circles that confuses it with news design. It reminds me of those stunning feature layouts that would draw a reader into a story as they flipped through the latest gloss-covered print that arrived in the mail. I am a product of my generation and will always have a sense of nostalgia for the dying art form, and I love seeing web-based implementations of it when they work well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly every one of Archeo&#8217;s image-categorized patterns captures that essence of a magazine featured article. The following is one of my favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Two-column image pattern with header on the left and additional text.\n\n\n\n<p>The theme is described as being inspired by Mayan history and culture. Archeo&#8217;s patterns are littered with tidbits of historical text and images that make me want to learn more about the subject. Great design can speak to us in ways that we were not expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside, I would love to see creators who describe their designs as &#8220;inspired by&#8221; something to provide more insight into the subject via a blog post. For those unfamiliar with whatever that subject may be, it would pull back the curtain a bit, giving us a glimpse into why it was important to the designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archeo is the first theme that I have seen use the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-web-fonts-api-has-arrived\">upcoming web fonts API</a> expected to land in WordPress 6.0. Users with the Gutenberg plugin installed should see the theme&#8217;s only font, Chivo, gracing the front end and editor. Those without the plugin should see their system&#8217;s default sans-serif font.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following screenshot is of the theme&#8217;s 404 template and shows the Chivo font:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />404 page template in site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>It looks far better than the default, at least on Windows. I recommend running this theme alongside the Gutenberg plugin for the ideal result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am surprised the Theme Team did not include a backward-compatible method of handling web fonts for WordPress 5.9 users. It would not have taken much code: a single hook and a check for whether the <code>wp_webfonts()</code> function exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archeo is now the 59th block theme to land in the WordPress.org directory. I am eager to see more from Automattic&#8217;s Theme Team, especially if this will be its minimum standard with future designs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 04:37:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 08 Apr 2022 13:38:49 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 08 Apr 2022 13:30:09 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172008\";}','no');
